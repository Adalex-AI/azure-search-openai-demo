APPEALS TO THE COUNTY COURT Appeals under sections 204 and 204 A of the Housing Act 1996\n\n28.1\n\n(1) An appellant should include appeals under section 204 and section 204 A of the Housing Act 1996 in one appellant's notice.\n\n(2) If it is not possible to do so (for example because an urgent application under section 204 A is required) the appeals may be included in separate appellant's notices.\n\n(3) An appeal under section 204 A may include an application for an order under section 204 A(4)(a) requiring the authority to secure that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation.\n\n(4) If, exceptionally, the court makes an order under section 204 A(4)(a) without notice, the appellant's notice must be served on the authority together with the order. Such an order will normally require the authority to secure that accommodation is available until a hearing date when the authority can make representations as to whether the order under section 204 A(4)(a) should be continued.\n\n(5) Unless the court orders otherwise -\n\n(a) the appellant shall file and serve its proposed case management directions for the appeal together with the appellant's notice;\n\n(b) the respondent shall within 14 days thereafter either agree those directions or file and serve alternative proposed directions;\n\n(c) within 14 days after service of the appellant's notice the respondent must disclose any documents relevant to the decision under appeal, in so far as not previously disclosed;\n\n(d) within 14 days after receipt of any documents disclosed under sub-paragraph (c) the appellant may make any amendments to its grounds of appeal which arise out of those documents.
