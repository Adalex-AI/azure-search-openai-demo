The following rules do not apply to a claim under this Practice Direction-\n\n(1) rule 8.2 A (issue of claim form without naming defendants);\n\n(2) rule 8.3 (acknowledgment of service);\n\n(3) rule 8.5 (filing and serving written evidence);\n\n(4) rule 8.6 (evidence - general);\n\n(5) rule 8.7 (counterclaims and other additional claims);\n\n(6) rule 8.8 (procedure where defendant objects to use of the Part 8 procedure); and\n\n(7) rule 8.9(c).\n\n---\n\nDefinitions\n\n3.1 References to 'the Court Proceedings Pack (Part A) Form', 'the Court Proceedings Pack (Part B) Form' and 'the CNF Response Form' are references to the forms used in the Protocols.\n\n3.2'Protocol offer' has the meaning given by rule 36.17.\n\n3.3'Settlement hearing' means a hearing where the court considers a settlement agreed between the parties (whether before or after proceedings have started) and the claimant is a child.\n\n3.4'Stage 3 hearing' means a final hearing to determine the amount of damages that remain in dispute between the parties.\n\n3.5 Accredited medical expert', 'fixed costs medical report', 'Med Co' and 'soft tissue injury claim' have the same meaning as in paragraph 1.1(A 1), (10 A), (12 A), and (16 A), respectively, of the RTA Protocol.\n\n---\n\nTypes of claim in which this modified Part 8 procedure may be followed\n\n4.1 The court may at any stage order a claim that has been started under Part 7 to continue under the Part 8 procedure as modified by this Practice Direction.\n\n---\n\nAn application to the court to determine the amount of damages\n\n5.1 An application to the court to determine the amount of damages must be started by a claim form.\n\n5.2 The claim form must state-\n\n(1) that the claimant has followed the procedure set out in the relevant Protocol;\n\n(2) the date when the Court Proceedings Pack (Part A and Part B) Form was sent to the defendant. (This provision does not apply where the claimant is a child and the application is for a settlement hearing);\n\n(3) whether the claimant wants the claim to be determined by the court on the papers (except where a party is a child) or at a Stage 3 hearing;\n\n(4) where the claimant seeks a settlement hearing or a Stage 3 hearing, the dates which the claimant requests should be avoided; and\n\n(5) the value of the claim.\n\n---\n\nFiling and serving written evidence\n\n6.1 The claimant must file with the claim form-\n\n(1) the Court Proceedings Pack (Part A) Form;\n\n(2) the Court Proceedings Pack (Part B) Form (the claimant and defendant's final offers) in a sealed envelope.

This statement will enable the court to decide whether to order the child to attend the settlement hearing.\n\n6.7 Where the defendant is uninsured and the Motor Insurers' Bureau ('MIB') or its agents have consented in the CNF Response Form to the MIB being joined as a defendant, the claimant must name the MIB as the second defendant and must also provide to the court a copy of the CNF Response Form completed by or on behalf of the MIB.\n\n6.8 Where this Practice Direction requires a step to be taken by the defendant, it will be sufficient for this step to be taken by the MIB.\n\n---\n\nEvidence - general\n\n7.1 The parties may not rely upon evidence unless-\n\n(1) it has been served in accordance with paragraph 6.5;\n\n(2) it has been filed in accordance with paragraph 8.2 and 11.3: or\n\n(3) (where the court considers that it cannot properly determine the claim without it), the court orders otherwise and gives directions.\n\n7.2 Where the court considers that-\n\n(1) further evidence must be provided by any party; and\n\n(2) the claim is not suitable to continue under the Stage 3 Procedure,\n\nthe court will order that the claim will continue under Part 7, allocate the claim to a track and give directions.\n\n7.3 Where paragraph 7.2 applies the court will not allow the Stage 3 fixed costs.\n\n---\n\nAcknowledgment of Service\n\n8.1 The defendant must file and serve an acknowledgment of service in Form N 210 B not more than 14 days after service of the claim form.\n\n8.2 The defendant must file and serve with the acknowledgment of service, or as soon as possible thereafter, a certificate that is in force.\n\n('Certificate' is defined in rule 36.15(1)(e)(i).)\n\n8.3 The acknowledgment of service must state whether the defendant-\n\n(1) (a) contests the amount of damages claimed;\n\n(b) contests the making of an order for damages;\n\n(c) disputes the court's jurisdiction; or\n\n(d) objects to the use of the Stage 3 Procedure;\n\n(2) wants the claim to be determined by the court on the papers or at a Stage 3 hearing.\n\n8.4 Where the defendant objects to the use of the Stage 3 Procedure reasons must be given in the acknowledgment of service.\n\n8.5 The acknowledgment of service may be signed and filed by the defendant's insurer who may give their address as the address for service.\n\n---\n\nDismissal of the claim\n\n9.1 Where the defendant opposes the claim because the claimant has-\n\n(1) not followed the procedure set out in the relevant Protocol; or\n\n(2) filed and served additional or new evidence with the claim form that had not been provided under the relevant Protocol,\n\nthe court will dismiss the claim and the claimant may start proceedings under Part 7.\n\n(Rule 45.35 sets out the costs consequences of failing to comply with the relevant Protocol.)\n\n---\n\nWithdrawal of the Protocol offer\n\n10.1 A party may only withdraw a Protocol offer after proceedings have started with the court's permission.
