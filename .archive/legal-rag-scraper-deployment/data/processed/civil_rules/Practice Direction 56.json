Only exceptional circumstances justify starting a claim in the High Court.\n\n(2) In the County Court, the claim will be issued by the County Court hearing centre where the claim is made and will then be sent to the County Court hearing centre which serves the address where the land is situated. A claimant should consider the potential delay which may result if a claim is not sent to the appropriate County Court hearing centre in the first instance.\n\n2.3 If a claimant starts a claim in the High Court and the court decides that it should have been started in the county court, the court will normally either strike the claim out or transfer it to the county court on its own initiative. This is likely to result in delay and the court will normally disallow the costs of starting the claim in the High Court and of any transfer.\n\n2.4 Circumstances which may, in an appropriate case, justify starting a claim in the High Court are if -\n\n(1) there are complicated disputes of fact; or\n\n(2) there are points of law of general importance.\n\n2.5 The value of the property and the amount of any financial claim may be relevant circumstances, but these factors alone will not normally justify starting the claim in the High Court.\n\n2.6 A landlord and tenant claim started in the High Court must be brought in the Chancery Division.\n\n(Where the tenant is a tied pub tenant of a pub-owning business under the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, the procedure provided by paragraphs 3.1 to 3.19 of this practice direction is modified by paragraphs 3.20 to 3.32.)
