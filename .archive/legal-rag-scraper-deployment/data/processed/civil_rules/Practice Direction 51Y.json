  "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 51 Y - VIDEO OR AUDIO HEARINGS DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements Part 51\n\n1.This practice direction, made under rule 51.2 of the Civil Procedure Rules (\"CPR\"), makes provision in relation to audio or video hearings. With the exception of the first sentence of paragraph 3, it ceases to have effect on the date on which the Coronavirus Act 2020 ceases to have effect in accordance with section 89 of that Act. The first sentence of paragraph 3 ceases to have effect on 25 March 2023.\n\n2.During the period in which this Direction is in force, where the court directs that proceedings are to be conducted wholly as video or audio proceedings and it is not practicable for the hearing to be broadcast in a court building, the court may direct that the hearing must take place in private where it is necessary to do so to secure the proper administration of justice.\n\n3.Where a media representative is able to access proceedings remotely while they are taking place, they will be public proceedings. In such circumstances it will not be necessary to make an order under paragraph 2 and such an order may not be made.\n\n4.Any hearing held in private under paragraph 2 must be recorded, where that is practicable, in a manner directed by the court. Where authorised under s.32 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 or s.85 A of the Courts Act 2003 (as inserted by the Coronavirus Act 2020), the court may direct the hearing to be video recorded, otherwise the hearing must be audio recorded. On the application of any person, any recording so made is to be accessed in a court building, with the consent of the court.",
