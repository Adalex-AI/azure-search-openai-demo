and\n\n(b) give evidence in relation to new matters which have arisen since the witness statement was served on the other parties.\n\n(4) The court will give permission under paragraph (3) only if it considers that there is good reason not to confine the evidence of the witness to the contents of his witness statement.\n\n(5) If a party who has served a witness statement does not-\n\n(a) call the witness to give evidence at trial;
