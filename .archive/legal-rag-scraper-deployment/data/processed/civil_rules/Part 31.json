but\n\n(b) he must state in his disclosure statement that inspection of those documents will not be permitted on the grounds that to do so would be disproportionate.\n\n(Rule 31.6 provides for standard disclosure)\n\n(Rule 31.10 makes provision for a disclosure statement)\n\n(Rule 31.12 provides for a party to apply for an order for specific inspection of documents)\n\n---\n\nMeaning of document\n\n31.4 In this Part -\n\n'document' means anything in which information of any description is recorded;

and\n\n(b) the court considers that the proposals are appropriate in all the circumstances,\n\nthe court may approve them without a hearing and give directions in the terms proposed.\n\n(7) At the first or any subsequent case management conference, the court will decide, having regard to the overriding objective and the need to limit disclosure to that which is necessary to deal with the case justly, which of the following orders to make in relation to disclosure -\n\n(a) an order dispensing with disclosure;\n\n(b) an order that a party disclose the documents on which it relies, and at the same time request any specific disclosure it requires from any other party;\n\n(c) an order that directs, where practicable, the disclosure to be given by each party on an issue by issue basis;\n\n(d) an order that each party disclose any documents which it is reasonable to suppose may contain information which enables that party to advance its own case or to damage that of any other party, or which leads to an enquiry which has either of those consequences;\n\n(e) an order that a party give standard disclosure;\n\n(f) any other order in relation to disclosure that the court considers appropriate.\n\n(8) The court may at any point give directions as to how disclosure is to be given, and in particular -\n\n(a) what searches are to be undertaken, of where, for what, in respect of which time periods and by whom and the extent of any search for electronically stored documents;\n\n(b) whether lists of documents are required;\n\n(c) how and when the disclosure statement is to be given;\n\n(d) in what format documents are to be disclosed (and whether any identification is required);\n\n(e) what is required in relation to documents that once existed but no longer exist;
