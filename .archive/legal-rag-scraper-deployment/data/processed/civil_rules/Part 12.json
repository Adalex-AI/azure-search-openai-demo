or\n\n(ii) for summary judgment under Part 24,\n\nand, in either case, that application has not been dealt with;\n\n(b) the defendant has satisfied the whole claim (including any claim for costs) on which the claimant is seeking judgment;\n\n(c)\n\n(i) the claimant is seeking judgment on a claim for money;

or\n\n(b) the times and rate at which it is to be paid by instalments.\n\n(2) Except where paragraph (4) applies, a default judgment on a claim for a specified amount of money obtained on filing a request, will be judgment for the amount of the claim (less any payments made) and costs, to be paid-\n\n(a) by the date or at the rate specified in the request for judgment;

and\n\n(b) pay costs.\n\n(Rule 12.8 sets out the procedure for deciding the amount of a judgment or the value of the goods.)\n\n(5) The claimant's right to enter judgment requiring the defendant to deliver goods is subject to rule 40.14 (judgment in favour of certain part owners relating to the detention of goods).\n\n---\n\nCounty court money claims\n\n12.6\n\n(1) If a claimant files a request for judgment in the County Court which includes an amount of money to be decided by the court in accordance with rules 12.4 and 12.5, the claim will be sent to the preferred hearing centre.\n\n(2) If a claim is sent to a preferred hearing centre under paragraph (1), any further correspondence should be sent to, and any further requests should be made at, the hearing centre to which the claim was sent.\n\n---\n\nInterest\n\n12.7\n\n(1) A default judgment on a claim for a specified amount of money obtained on the filing of a request may include the amount of interest claimed to the date of judgment if-\n\n(a )the particulars of claim include the details required by rule 16.4;\n\n(b) where interest is claimed under section 35 A of the Senior Courts Act 1981 or section 69 of the County Courts Act 1984, the rate is no higher than the rate of interest payable on judgment debts at the date when the claim form was issued; and\n\n(c) the claimant's request for judgment includes a calculation of interest from the date up to which interest was calculated in the claim form up to the date of the request for judgment.\n\n(2) In any case where paragraph (1) does not apply, judgment will be for an amount of interest to be decided by the court.\n\n(Rule 12.8 sets out the procedure for deciding the amount of interest.)\n\n---\n\nProcedure for deciding an amount or value\n\n12.8\n\n(1) This rule applies where the claimant obtains a default judgment on the filing of a request under rule 12.4(1) and judgment is for-\n\n(a) an amount of money to be decided by the court;\n\n(b) the value of goods to be decided by the court; or\n\n(c) an amount of interest to be decided by the court.\n\n(2) Where the court enters judgment it will-\n\n(a) give any directions it considers appropriate; and\n\n(b) if it considers it appropriate, allocate the case.\n\n---\n\nClaim against more than one defendant\n\n12.9\n\n(1) A claimant may obtain a default judgment on request under this Part on a claim for money or a claim for delivery of goods against one of two or more defendants, and proceed with the claim against the other defendants.\n\n(2) Where a claimant applies for a default judgment against one of two or more defendants-\n\n(a) if the claim can be dealt with separately from the claim against the other defendants-\n\n(i) the court may enter a default judgment against that defendant; and\n\n(ii) the claimant may continue the proceedings against the other defendants;\n\n(b) if the claim cannot be dealt with separately from the claim against the other defendants-\n\n(i) the court will not enter default judgment against that defendant; and\n\n(ii) the court must deal with the application at the same time as it deals with the claim against the other defendants.\n\n(3) A claimant may not enforce against one of two or more defendants any judgment obtained under this Part for possession of land or for delivery of goods unless-\n\n(a) they have obtained a judgment for possession or delivery (whether or not obtained under this Part) against all the defendants to the claim;
