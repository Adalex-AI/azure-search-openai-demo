Only exceptional circumstances justify starting a claim in the High Court.\n\n(2) In the County Court, the claim will be issued by the County Court hearing centre where the claim is made, but will then be sent to the County Court hearing centre which serves the address where the land is situated. A claimant shouldconsider the potential delay which may result if a claim is not made at the appropriate hearing centre in the first instance.\n\n1.2 If a claimant starts a claim in the High Court and the court decides that it should have been started in the County Court, the court will normally either strike the claim out or transfer it to the County Court on its own initiative. This is likely to result in delay and the court will normally disallow the costs of starting the claim in the High Court and of any transfer.\n\n1.3 Circumstances which may, in an appropriate case, justify starting a claim in the High Court are if -\n\n(1) there are complicated disputes of fact;\n\n(2) there are points of law of general importance; or\n\n(3) the claim is against trespassers and there is a substantial risk of public disturbance or of serious harm to persons or property which properly require immediate determination.\n\n1.4 The value of the property and the amount of any financial claim may be relevant circumstances, but these factors alone will not normally justify starting the claim in the High Court.\n\n1.5 The claimant must use the appropriate claim form and particulars of claim form. The defence must be in form N 11,N 11 B,N 11 Mor N 11 R, as appropriate.\n\n1.6 High Court claims for the possession of land subject to a mortgage will be assigned to the Chancery Division.\n\n1.7 A claim which is not a possession claim may be brought under the procedure set out in Section I of Part 55 if it is started in the same claim form as a possession claim which, by virtue of rule 55.2(1) must be brought in accordance with that Section.\n\n(Rule 7.3 provides that a claimant may use a single claim form to start all claims which can be conveniently disposed of in the same proceedings)\n\n1.8 For example a claim under paragraphs 4, 5 or 6 of Part I of Schedule 1 to the Mobile Homes Act 1983 may be brought using the procedure set out in Section I of Part 55 if the claim is started in the same claim form as a claim enforcing the rights referred to in section 3(1)(b) of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (which, by virtue of rule 55.2(1) must be brought under Section I of Part 55).\n\n1.9 Where the claim form includes a demotion claim, the claim must be started in the County Court for the district in which the land is situated.\n\n---\n\n55.4 - PARTICULARS OF CLAIM\n\n2.1 In a possession claim the particulars of claim must:\n\n(1) identify the land to which the claim relates;\n\n(2) state whether the claim relates to residential property;\n\n(3) state the ground on which possession is claimed;\n\n(4) give full details about any mortgage or tenancy agreement; and\n\n(5) give details of every person who, to the best of the claimant's knowledge, is in possession of the property.\n\n---\n\nResidential property let on a tenancy\n\n2.2 Paragraphs 2.3 to 2.4 B apply if the claim relates to residential property let on a tenancy.\n\n2.3 If the claim includes a claim for non-payment of rent the particulars of claim must set out:\n\n(1) the amount due at the start of the proceedings;\n\n(2) in schedule form, the dates and amounts of all payments due and payments made under the tenancy agreement for a period of two years immediately preceding the date of issue, or if the first date of default occurred less than two years before the date of issue from the first date of default and a running total of the arrears;\n\n(3) the daily rate of any rent and interest;\n\n(4) any previous steps taken to recover the arrears of rent with full details of any court proceedings; and\n\n(5) any relevant information about the defendant's circumstances, in particular:\n\n(a) whether the defendant is in receipt of social security benefits; and\n\n(b) whether any payments are made on his behalf directly to the claimant under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.\n\n2.3 AIf the claimant wishes to rely on a history of arrears which is longer than two years, he should state this in his particulars and exhibit a full (or longer) schedule to a witness statement.\n\n2.4 If the claimant knows of any person (including a mortgagee) entitled to claim relief against forfeiture as underlessee under section 146(4) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (or in accordance with section 38 of the Senior Courts Act 1981, or section 138(9 C) of the County Courts Act 1984):\n\n(1) the particulars of claim must state the name and address of that person;

or\n\n(c) a notice under section 31(10) of the Family Law Act 1996 has been registered and on whose behalf; and\n\nif so, that the claimant will serve notice of the claim on the persons on whose behalf the land charge is registered or the notice or caution entered.\n\n(2) the state of the mortgage account by including:\n\n(a) the amount of:\n\n(i) the advance;\n\n(ii) any periodic repayment;

and\n\n(b) the dates and terms of any orders made.\n\n2.5 AIf the claimant wishes to rely on a history of arrears which is longer than two years, he should state this in his particulars and exhibit a full (or longer) schedule to a witness statement.\n\n---\n\nPossession claim against trespassers\n\n2.6 If the claim is a possession claim against trespassers, the particulars of claim must state the claimant's interest in the land or the basis of his right to claim possession and the circumstances in which it has been occupied without licence or consent.\n\n---\n\nPossession claim in relation to a demoted tenancy by a housing action trust or a local housing authority\n\n2.7 If the claim is a possession claim under section 143 D of the Housing Act 1996 (possession claim in relation to a demoted tenancy where the landlord is a housing action trust or a local housing authority), the particulars of claim must have attached to them a copy of the notice to the tenant served under section 143 E of the 1996 Act.\n\n---\n\n55.5 - HEARING DATE\n\n3.1 The court may exercise its powers under rules 3.1(2)(a) and (b) to shorten the time periods set out in rules 55.5(2) and (3).\n\n3.2 Particular consideration should be given to the exercise of this power if:\n\n(1) the defendant, or a person for whom the defendant is responsible, has assaulted or threatened to assault:\n\n(a) the claimant;\n\n(b) a member of the claimant's staff;

Each party should wherever possible include all the evidence he wishes to present in his statement of case, verified by a statement of truth.\n\n5.2 If relevant the claimant's evidence should include the amount of any rent or mortgage arrears and interest on those arrears. These amounts should, if possible, be up to date to the date of the hearing (if necessary by specifying a daily rate of arrears and interest). However, rule 55.8(4) does not prevent such evidence being brought up to date orally or in writing on the day of the hearing if necessary.\n\n5.3 If relevant the defendant should give evidence of:\n\n(1) the amount of any outstanding social security or housing benefit payments relevant to rent or mortgage arrears; and\n\n(2) the status of:\n\n(a) any claims for social security or housing benefit about which a decision has not yet been made; and\n\n(b) any applications to appeal or review a social security or housing benefit decision where that appeal or review has not yet concluded.\n\n5.4 If:\n\n(1) the maker of a witness statement does not attend a hearing; and\n\n(2) the other party disputes material evidence contained in his statement,\n\nthe court will normally adjourn the hearing so that oral evidence can be given.\n\n5.5 The claimant must bring 2 completed copies of Form N 123 to the hearing.\n\n---\n\nCONSUMER CREDIT ACT CLAIMS RELATING TO THE RECOVERY OF LAND\n\n7.1 Any application by the defendant for a time order under section 129 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 may be made:\n\n(1) in his defence; or\n\n(2) by application notice in the proceedings.\n\n---\n\nENFORCEMENT OF CHARGING ORDER BY SALE\n\n7.2 A party seeking to enforce a charging order by sale should follow the procedure set out in rule 73.10 and the Part 55 procedure should not be used.\n\n---\n\nSECTION II - ACCELERATED POSSESSION CLAIMS OF PROPERTY LET ON AN ASSURED SHORTHOLD TENANCY\n\n---\n\n55.18 - POSTPONEMENT OF POSSESSION\n\nA 8.1 In the County Court, the claim will be issued by the County Court hearing centre where the claim is made, but will then be sent to the County Court hearing centre which serves the address where the land is situated. A claimant should consider the potential delay which may result if a claim is not made at the appropriate hearing centre in the first instance.\n\n8.1 If the judge is satisfied as to the matters set out in rule 55.16(2), he will make an order for possession in accordance with rule 55.17, whether or not the defendant seeks a postponement of possession on the ground of exceptional hardship under section 89 of the Housing Act 1980.\n\n8.2 In a claim in which the judge is satisfied that the defendant has shown exceptional hardship, he will only postpone possession without directing a hearing under rule 55.18(1) if -\n\n(1) he considers that possession should be given up 6 weeks after the date of the order or, if the defendant has requested postponement to an earlier date, on that date; and\n\n(2) the claimant indicated on his claim form that he would be content for the court to make such an order without a hearing.\n\n8.3 In all other cases if the defendant seeks a postponement of possession under section 89 of the Housing Act 1980, the judge will direct a hearing under rule 55.18(1).\n\n8.4 If, at that hearing, the judge is satisfied that exceptional hardship would be caused by requiring possession to be given up by the date in the order of possession, he may vary that order under rule 55.18(3) so that possession is to be given up at a later date. That later date may be no later than 6 weeks after the making of the order for possession on the papers (see section 89 of the Housing Act 1980).\n\n---\n\nSECTION III - INTERIM POSSESSION ORDERS\n\n9.1 The claim form must be in form N 5, the application notice seeking the interim possession order must be in form N 130 and the defendant's witness statement must be in form N 133.\n\n9.2 The IPO will be in form N 134 (annexed to this practice direction).\n\n---\n\nSECTION IV - ORDERS FIXING A DATE FOR POSSESSION\n\n10.1 This paragraph applies where the court has made an order postponing the date for possession under section 85(2)(b) of the Housing Act 1985 (secure tenancies) or under section 9(2)(b) of the Housing Act 1988 (assured tenancies).\n\n10.2 If the defendant fails to comply with any of the terms of the order which relate to payment, the claimant, after following the procedure set out in paragraph 10.3, may apply for an order fixing the date upon which the defendant has to give up possession of the property. Unless the court further postpones the date for possession, the defendant will be required to give up possession on that date.\n\n10.3 At least 14 days and not more than 3 months before applying for an order under paragraph 10.2, the claimant must give written notice to the defendant in accordance with paragraph 10.4.\n\n10.4 The notice referred to in paragraph 10.3 must -\n\n(1) state that the claimant intends to apply for an order fixing the date upon which the defendant is to give up possession of the property;\n\n(2) record the current arrears and state how the defendant has failed to comply with the order referred to in paragraph 10.1 (by reference to a statement of the rent account enclosed with the notice);\n\n(3) request that the defendant reply to the claimant within 7 days, agreeing or disputing the stated arrears; and\n\n(4) inform the defendant of his right to apply to the court -\n\n(a) for a further postponement of the date for possession; or\n\n(b) to stay or suspend enforcement.\n\n10.5 In his reply to the notice, the defendant must -\n\n(1) where he disputes the stated arrears, provide details of payments or credits made;\n\n(2) where he agrees the stated arrears, explain why payments have not been made.\n\n10.6 An application for an order under paragraph 10.2 must be made by filing an application notice in accordance with Part 23.
