and\n\n(e) pay the appropriate fee.\n\n2.4 Proceedings issued in the Rolls Building Jurisdictions, the B&PCs District Registries, the Central Office of the King's Bench Division, QB DRs and the Costs Office, and the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) will be stored by the Court as an electronic case file (\"the Electronic Working Case File\").\n\n2.5 The Website contains further details, updated from time to time, on how to complete a filing, including in the event of down-time or where a particular document format is not compatible with Electronic Working, information about the timing of any planned down-time, and a support email address to contact in the event of any down-time or when experiencing any other technical difficulty in using the Website.\n\n---\n\nElectronic Working and alternate filing methods\n\n3.1 Any document which is filed using Electronic Working must not also be filed by some other means unless this is required by paragraphs 3.4(2), 10, 11 and 13 or a rule or practice direction, or Court order or Practice Note.\n\n3.2 Proceedings which have not been started using Electronic Working may be continued using Electronic Working (subject to the provisions in paragraph 1.1(1)(c)) after documents originally submitted in those proceedings have been converted to PDF format. The proceedings shall then continue as if they had been started using Electronic Working.\n\n3.3 To permit use of Electronic Working for proceedings initially started by other means-\n\n(a) the Court will, where appropriate, seal the paper copy of the document;\n\n(b) the parties will pay any fee due;\n\n(c) the Court will either request that the party provide the document in PDF format or scan the document into PDF format and store it on the Electronic Working Case File; and thereafter\n\n(d) the parties will, subject to paragraph 3.5, file documents needing to be filed through Electronic Working in accordance with this Practice Direction.\n\n3.4\n\n(1) The Court may refuse to convert documents to PDF format where those documents were originally submitted by some other means.\n\n(2) In relation to any document required by the Rules, any Practice Direction or any order of the court to be filed, the Court will not accept that document for filing if submitted by e-mail and any such document must be filed through Electronic Working (unless submitted on paper); but if a judge or a court officer authorised to exercise the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal (as defined in rule 52.24) has requested or permitted the submission of such a document by e-mail then it must be so submitted as well as being filed through Electronic Working (or on paper).\n\n3.5\n\n(1) Where an original document is required by order of the Court or by provision of the CPR or IR 1986 or 2016 to be filed, such original document cannot be filed using Electronic Working and must instead be physically filed with the Court.\n\n(2) This includes original wills, grants of probate or evidence of testamentary documents which must be filed physically with the Court in order for contentious probate claims to be issued. As a result, contentious probate claims cannot be issued using Electronic Working unless the Court permits.\n\n---\n\nOriginal documents\n\n4 Where parties file documents using Electronic Working, the original signed documents, including the original exhibits to any witness statement filed, must be preserved and must be made available for inspection if required by another party to the proceedings and/or by order of the Court.\n\n---\n\nGeneral rules regarding issue and filing\n\n5.1 Any document which is filed using Electronic Working must-\n\n(a) consist of one copy only unless required by a Court order, rule or practice direction;\n\n(b) be in PDF format (or in Excel format if appropriate) unless the Court directs otherwise or unless the document is a draft order, in which case it shall be in \"Word\" format;\n\n(c) not exceed 50 (fifty) megabytes or such other limit that may be specified by Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service; and\n\n(d) be categorised or labelled as to the type of document that it is (e.g. \"Claim Form\", \"Witness Statement\", \"Exhibit\") and numbered sequentially.\n\n5.2\n\n(1) In the event that a document exceeds the maximum limit specified in paragraph 5.1(c), the party seeking to file the document shall divide the document into parts and file each part separately.\n\n(2) Parties can, in one filing, file up to 10 (ten) documents with each document not exceeding 50 (fifty) megabytes or such other limit specified by HMCTS.\n\n5.2 AIn the event that a document is confidential and is required to be filed, it must, when filed in the Electronic Working Case File, be filed as a confidential document, using the process set up in Electronic Working for that purpose, in order to ensure that it is not visible to everyone.\n\n5.3\n\n(1) Submission of any document using Electronic Working will generate an automated notification acknowledging that the document has been submitted and is being reviewed by the Court prior to being accepted (the \"Acceptance\").\n\n(2) The court may make an order to remedy an error of procedure made while using Electronic Working, in accordance with CPR 3.10(b). When the court makes such an order, a document filing will not fail Acceptance because of the error of procedure made.\n\n(3) Court staff may refuse to include a submitted document in its corresponding Electronic Working Case File if the document has been scanned and saved upside down or is otherwise illegible or incomplete.\n\n(4) Where Court staff has not included a submitted document on its corresponding Electronic Working Case File for one of the reasons listed in paragraph 5.3(3), the submission will not have failed Acceptance, but the party having made the submission will have to upload the document again in accordance with Court staff instructions in order for the document to be properly included on the corresponding Electronic Working Case File.\n\n5.4\n\n(1) Where payment of a court fee is required to accompany the filing of a document, the date and time of filing on Electronic Working will be deemed to be the date and time at which payment of the Court fee is made using Electronic Working.\n\n(2) The date and time of payment will also be the date and time of issue for all claim forms and other originating processes submitted using Electronic Working.\n\n(3) For all other document filings, the date and time of filing will be the submission date and time for the purposes of any direction under the appropriate rules or for the purposes of complying with an order of the Court, unless expressly provided otherwise by the Court.\n\n(4) Once a document filing is accepted, a notification will appear on the Electronic Working online account registered to the filing party to confirm that the document has been accepted and to confirm the date and time of issue or the date and time of filing in accordance with paragraphs 5.4(1) to 5.4(3).\n\n(5) The date and time of issue or the date and time of filing of a document submitted using Electronic Working will not be delayed by Acceptance, unless the submission fails Acceptance because the filing error is more serious than an error of procedure, or the Court orders that it has failed Acceptance for some other reason.\n\n(6) If the submission fails Acceptance, notice of the reasons for failure will be given to the party on that party's Electronic Working online account and if the submission was of a claim form, appeal notice, or other document requiring to be issued, it will be deemed not to have been issued.\n\n(7) In cases where payment of the Court fee has already been made and a claim form or other originating application fails Acceptance, the fee will be refunded and a corrected claim form or originating application will have to be submitted and the Court fee paid again in order for proceedings to be issued. In such cases, the new submission will generate a new date and time of issue or date and time of filing in accordance with paragraphs 5.4(1) to 5.4(3).\n\n5.5 A claim form or other originating application filed by a party using Electronic Working will, subject to Acceptance and payment, be issued in the relevant Rolls Building Jurisdiction, B&PC District Registry, the Central Office of the King's Bench Division QB DRs, the Costs Office, or the Court of Appeal (Civil Division), and the claim will proceed in that Court unless it is transferred to another Court.\n\n5.6 If any documents that are not required by any rule, practice direction, order or direction to be filed are submitted via Electronic Working, they may not be retained on the online account and/or Electronic Working Case File.\n\n---\n\nPayment of fees\n\n6.1\n\n(1) Where any rule or practice direction provides for a fee to be paid, a party filing a document using Electronic Working must, except in circumstances specified in sub-paragraph (4), pay the appropriate fee by account or by credit/debit card or by any other online method specified by Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service.\n\n(1 A) When a party enters its payment by account number into Electronic Working when prompted by Electronic Working to do so, that party will be deemed to have made the payment. The party will thereby owe the relevant court fee to Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service.\n\n(2) The court will keep a record of when payment was made or deemed to have been made.\n\n(3) In proceedings where payment under the Insolvency Rules is required to be made in a manner that precludes online payment (such as the official receiver's deposit for a winding up petition, which must be paid by cheque), parties will be able to use Electronic Working to initiate those proceedings, but must post or deliver payment to the Court within seven calendar days of submitting the originating application document(s). Failure to do so may result in the originating application failing Acceptance or the petition being struck out.\n\n(4) For filings other than the issue of originating proceedings which incur payment of a fee, a party who is not legally represented and who wishes to pay that fee by account or by credit/debit card must make the filing and the payment through Electronic Working.\n\n6.2 A party who has applied or wishes to apply for Help with Fees or partial Help with Fees must contact the Court to obtain a Help with Fees payment by account number, prior to using Electronic Working to issue a claim or to initiate other proceedings requiring the payment of a court fee.\n\n---\n\nElectronic sealing\n\n7.1 When the Court issues a claim form, appeal notice or other originating application which has been submitted using Electronic Working and accepted by the Court, the Court will electronically seal the claim form, appeal notice or originating application with the date on which the relevant Court fee was paid and this shall be the issue date, as per the provisions of paragraph 5.4.\n\n7.2 The electronic seal may differ in appearance to the seal used on paper.\n\n---\n\nService\n\n8.1 The Court will electronically return the sealed and issued claim form, appeal notice or originating application to the party's Electronic Working online account and notify the party that it is ready for service.\n\n8.2 Unless the Court orders otherwise, any document filed by any party or issued by the Court using Electronic Working in the Rolls Building Jurisdictions, B&PC District Registry, the Central Office of the King's Bench Division QB DRs, the Costs Office, or the Court of Appeal (Civil Division), which is required to be served shall be served by the parties and not the Court.\n\n8.3 The CPR and IR 2016 as to filing evidence of service apply.\n\n---\n\nCalculation of time periods\n\n8 ANotwithstanding the operation of Electronic Working outlined in paragraph 2.1 above, CPR rule 2.8 applies, where relevant, to any issue, filing, or other originating application, including the presentation of a winding-up petition or a bankruptcy petition, made through Electronic Working.\n\n---\n\nTransfer of proceedings and file transmission\n\n9.1\n\n(1) If proceedings which have used Electronic Working are subsequently transferred to a jurisdiction not operating Electronic Working, no documents will be able to be filed in those proceedings through Electronic Working after the date of transfer and this Practice Direction will cease to apply to those proceedings.\n\n(2) Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service shall make arrangements for a version of the Electronic Working Case File of the transferred proceedings to be made available to the receiving Court in a format requested by the receiving Court.\n\n9.2 Where a request for transmission of the Court file of any insolvency proceedings is made pursuant to IR 2016 rule 12.39(12), the Court shall make arrangements for a version of the Electronic Working Case File of the proceedings being transmitted to be made available to the Secretary of State or the official receiver, as the case may be, in a format of their choosing.\n\n9.3 If proceedings are transferred into one of the Rolls Building Jurisdictions, B&PC District Registry, the Central Office of the King's Bench Division QB DRs, the Costs Office, or the Court of Appeal (Civil Division),, all filing subsequent to the order transferring those proceedings may be done using Electronic Working after documents originally submitted in those proceedings have been converted to PDF format in accordance with paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3.\n\n---\n\nApplications in proceedings\n\n10.1\n\n(1) Where a party to proceedings files an application for an order or other relief using Electronic Working and a hearing is required, the party filing the application shall lodge an application bundle with the Court.\n\n(2) The application bundle may be lodged in electronic format.\n\n10.2 The application bundle must-\n\n(a) also be filed as a paper copy, unless otherwise stated either by order or in a practice direction;\n\n(b) contain the application notice and any evidence filed in the application, including exhibits together with such other documents as may be required by any rule, practice direction, order of the Court or relevant Court guide; and\n\n(c) be filed in accordance with the time limits required by any applicable rule, practice direction, order of the Court or relevant Court guide or, in the absence of such a requirement, 3 (three) days before the hearing.\n\n10.3 The electronic copy of the application bundle must-\n\n(a) be filed using Electronic Working;\n\n(b) either (i) comply with the formatting requirements of any rule, practice direction, order of the court or relevant Court guide; or (ii) where no relevant requirements within (i) apply be formatted as one PDF document with bookmarks as appropriate for each document and with section headings within the document, unless its size exceeds 50 (fifty) megabytes, in which case it can be divided into up to 10 (ten) documents of that size, each bearing bookmarks as appropriate; and\n\n(c) be updated as required and filed in compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) above.\n\n10.4 Where the application bundle is also provided in paper format that must be indexed and paginated so as to correspond exactly to the electronic version of the bundle.\n\n---\n\nCase and cost management and other directions\n\n11.1 Where-\n\n(a) a rule, practice direction, or order of the Court requires-\n\n(i) the Court to give case or cost management or other directions, whether at a hearing or not; and\n\n(ii) a bundle to be filed with the Court in connection with case or cost management or other directions; and\n\n(b) a party wishes to file the bundle using Electronic Working,\n\nthe bundle must contain such documents as are required by any rule, practice direction, order of the Court or Court guide.\n\n11.2 The Bundle must be filed in paper copy as well, unless the Court orders otherwise.\n\n11.3 The claimant, applicant or petitioner, as appropriate, shall be responsible for ensuring the electronic copy of the bundle complies with the requirements specified in paragraph 10.3 above.\n\n11.4 The claimant, applicant or petitioner, as appropriate, shall be responsible for ensuring the paper copy is indexed and corresponds exactly with the electronic version of the bundle with sequential pagination.\n\n---\n\nStatements of truth\n\n12 CPR Part 22 and the practice direction supplementing that part and any rule applicable to the Bankruptcy and Companies Courts which require certain forms and documents to be verified by a statement of truth shall apply to any forms or documents filed using Electronic Working.\n\n---\n\nTrial bundles\n\n13.1 The trial bundle must be filed with the Court in paper format.\n\n13.2 An electronic version of the trial bundle must also be filed if the Court so orders, in which case it must comply with the requirements of paragraph 10.3 and the paper copy must comply with paragraph 10.4.\n\n13.3 The Court will retain any electronic copy of the trial bundle for a period of 2 (two) months after judgment has been delivered, after which it may be deleted.\n\n13.4 The time in paragraph 13.3 may be extended by order of the court at the request of a party or on the court's own initiative.\n\n---\n\nBundles in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division)\n\n14.1 A bundle in support of an application for permission to appeal may be filed using Electronic Working providing the bundle complies with the requirements at paragraph 10.3.\n\n14.2 If a bundle in support of an application for permission to appeal is filed in paper format the court may order an electronic version also to be filed.\n\n14.3 Bundles for appeal hearings must be filed with the court in paper format.\n\n14.4 An electronic version of the appeal bundle must also be filed if the court so orders, in which case it must comply with the requirements of paragraph 10.3 and the paper copy must comply with paragraph 10.4.\n\n14.5 The court will retain any electronic copy bundles for a period of 2 (two) months after judgment has been delivered, after which they may be deleted.\n\n14.6 The time in paragraph 14.5 may be extended by order of the court at the request of a party or on the court's own initiative.\n\n---\n\nInspection of documents on the Electronic Working Case File by parties or permitted persons\n\n15.1 In addition to any inspection facility that may be available through the Website or a party's Electronic Working online account, the parties to any proceedings except insolvency proceedings, or their legal representatives, shall be entitled to inspect an electronic record of the proceedings in person at the Court on a terminal provided for that purpose by Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service and obtain electronic copies of documents contained in the Electronic Working Case File subject to the provisions of CPR rule 5.4 B.\n\n15.2 In addition to any inspection facility that may be available through the Website or a party's Electronic Working online account, persons permitted by IR 2016 rule 12.39(3)-(6) to inspect the Court file of insolvency proceedings shall be entitled to inspect an electronic record of the proceedings in person at the Court on a terminal provided for that purpose by Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service and obtain, subject to paragraph 15.2, electronic copies of documents contained in the Electronic Working Case File, unless permission of the Court is required under IR 2016 rule 12.39(9)-(10) and subject to rule 12.39(7) and (11) and Chapter 10.\n\n15.3 The Electronic Working Case File will be updated by the Court as and when documents are filed by the parties and accepted.\n\n15.4 Information concerning the availability of the facility outlined in paragraph 15.1 will be communicated by Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service on the Website.\n\n---\n\nPublic kiosk service for the electronic inspection of publicly available documents\n\n16.1 A public kiosks are available at the Royal Courts of Justice both at the Strand and at the Rolls Building, London, for non-parties to proceedings governed by the CPR, to enable such non-parties to examine an electronic record of the proceedings and determine whether any documents in relation to the proceedings are publicly available.\n\n16.2 Persons wishing to obtain copies of documents available to non-parties in accordance with CPR rule 5.4 C must-\n\n(a) complete the appropriate office copy request form;
