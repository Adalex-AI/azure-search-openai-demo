In respect of proceedings in the High Court, Section II of this Practice Direction sets out the matters over which Masters or District Judges do not have jurisdiction or which they may deal with only on certain conditions. References to Circuit Judges include Recorders and references to Masters and District Judges include Deputies.\n\n1.1 ACircuit Judges and District Judges may exercise any jurisdiction conferred on the County Court or on a judge of the County Court. Section III of this Practice Direction sets out the matters that will be allocated to a Circuit Judge as well as those that may, or will normally, be allocated to a District Judge.\n\n1.1 BThis Practice Direction does not affect jurisdiction conferred by other enactments. Reference should also be made to other relevant Practice Directions (eg, Part 24, paragraph 3 and Part 26, paragraphs 12.1-10).

District Judges (including District Judges of the Principal Registry of the Family Division) have jurisdiction to hear such proceedings, subject to any Direction given by the President of the Family Division.\n\n1.2 Masters or District Judges who have jurisdiction to hear a matter or to whom a matter has been allocated, may refer that matter to a Judge instead of dealing with it themselves.\n\n1.3 For the purpose of this Practice Direction, in the County Court-\n\n(a) 'Circuit Judge' means, in addition to a Circuit Judge, all judges of the Senior Courts, including retired and deputy judges of those courts, Recorders and Upper Tribunal judges (including the Senior President of Tribunals, Chamber Presidents, deputy Presidents of the Upper Tribunal and deputy judges of the Upper Tribunal, but excluding District Judges and District Judges (Magistrates' Courts)) and the Judge Advocate General; and\n\n(b) 'District Judge' means all other Courts and tribunal judges, and High Court Officers (for example, Masters and Registrars), including deputy or temporary High Court Officers, who are judges of the County Court under section 5 of the County Courts Act 1984.\n\n---\n\nSECTION II - THE HIGH COURT\n\n---\n\nInjunctions, Pre-trial Orders and Interim Remedies\n\n2.Search orders (rule 25.1(1)(h)), freezing orders (rule 25.1(1)(f)) and an ancillary order under rule 25.1(1)(g) may only be made by a Judge.\n\n3.1 A Master or District Judge may not make orders or grant interim remedies-\n\n(a) relating to the liberty of the subject;\n\n(b) relating to criminal proceedings or matters except procedural applications in appeals to the High Court (including appeals by case stated) under any enactment;\n\n(c) relating to a claim for judicial review, except that interim applications in claims for judicial review may be made to Masters of the King's Bench Division;\n\n(d) relating to appeals from Masters or District Judges;\n\n(e) in appeals against costs assessment under Parts 44 to 47, except on an appeal under rule 47.21 against the decision of an authorised court officer;\n\n(f) in applications under section 42 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 by a person subject to a Civil or a Criminal or an All Proceedings Order (vexatious litigant) for permission to start or continue proceedings; or\n\ng) in applications under section 139 of the Mental Health Act 1983 for permission to bring proceedings against a person.\n\n3.1 ANotwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3.1 a Master of the Crown Office or a Master of the Administrative Court may-\n\n(a) make orders and grant interim remedies relating to claims for judicial review (including claims for judicial review relating to criminal causes, appeals under the Extradition Act 2003 and applications to vary bail conditions, provided the prosecutor does not oppose the variation);\n\n(b) determine liability for costs and make summary assessments of costs in relation to claims for judicial review; and\n\n(c) make orders and grant interim remedies relating to applications under section 42 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 for permission to start or continue claims for judicial review.\n\n---\n\nEarly Trials\n\n4.1 A Master or District Judge may only give directions for early trial after consulting the Head of the relevant Division or a Judge nominated by the Head of Division.\n\n---\n\nAssignment of Claims to Masters and Transfer between Masters\n\n6.1 The Senior Master and the Chief Master will make arrangements for proceedings to be assigned to individual Masters.
