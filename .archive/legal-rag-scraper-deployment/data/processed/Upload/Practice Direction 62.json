The judge hearing the application may adjourn the matter for oral argument before two judges of that court.\n\n62.4 - Arbitration claim form\n\nService\n\n---\n\n3.1\n\nThe court may exercise its powers under rule 6.15 to permit service of an arbitration claim form at the address of a party's solicitor or representative acting for that party in the arbitration.\n\n3.2\n\nWhere the arbitration claim form is served by the claimant he must file a certificate of service within 7 days of service of the arbitration claim form.\n\n(Rule 6.17 specifies what a certificate of service must show).\n\nAcknowledgment of service or making representations by arbitrator or ACAS\n\n---\n\n4.1\n\nWhere -\n\n(1) an arbitrator; or\n\n(2) ACAS (in a claim under the 1996 Act as applied with modifications by the ACAS Arbitration Scheme (England and Wales) Order 2001)\n\nis sent a copy of an arbitration claim form (including an arbitration claim form sent under rule 62.6(2)), that arbitrator or ACAS (as the case may be) may -\n\n(a) apply to be made a defendant; or\n\n(b) make representations to the court under paragraph 4.3.\n\n---\n\n4.2\n\nAn application under paragraph 4.1(2)(a) to be made a defendant -\n\n(1) must be served on the claimant; but\n\n(2) need not be served on any other party.\n\n4.3\n\nAn arbitrator or ACAS may make representations by filing written evidence or in writing to the court.\n\nSupply of documents from court records\n\n5.1\n\nAn arbitration claim form may only be inspected with the permission of the court.\n\n62.7 - Case management\n\n6.1\n\nThe following directions apply unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n---\n\n6.2\n\nA defendant who wishes to rely on evidence before the court must file and serve his written evidence -\n\n(1) within 21 days after the date by which he was required to acknowledge service; or,\n\n(2) where a defendant is not required to file an acknowledgement of service, within 21 days after service of the arbitration claim form.\n\n---\n\n6.3\n\nA claimant who wishes to rely on evidence in reply to written evidence filed under paragraph 6.2 must file and serve his written evidence within 7 days after service of the defendant's evidence.\n\n6.4\n\nAgreed indexed and paginated bundles of all the evidence and other documents to be used at the hearing must be prepared by the claimant.\n\n---\n\n6.5\n\nNot later than 5 days before the hearing date estimates for the length of the hearing must be filed together with a complete set of the documents to be used.\n\n---\n\n6.6\n\nNot later than 2 days before the hearing date the claimant must file and serve -\n\n(1) a chronology of the relevant events cross-referenced to the bundle of documents;\n\n(2) (where necessary) a list of the persons involved; and\n\n(3) a skeleton argument which lists succinctly -\n\n(a) the issues which arise for decision;\n\n(b) the grounds of relief (or opposing relief) to be relied upon;\n\n(c) the submissions of fact to be made with the references to the evidence; and\n\n(d) the submissions of law with references to the relevant authorities.\n\n---\n\n6.7\n\nNot later than the day before the hearing date the defendant must file and serve a skeleton argument which lists succinctly -\n\n(1) the issues which arise for decision;\n\n(2) the grounds of relief (or opposing relief) to be relied upon;\n\n(3) the submissions of fact to be made with the references to the evidence; and\n\n(4) the submissions of law with references to the relevant authorities.\n\nSecuring the attendance of witnesses\n\n---\n\n7.1\n\nA party to arbitral proceedings being conducted in England or Wales who wishes to rely on section 43 of the 1996 Act to secure the attendance of a witness must apply for a witness summons in accordance with Part 34.\n\n7.2\n\nIf the attendance of the witness is required within the district of a district registry, the application may be made at that registry.\n\n---\n\n7.3\n\nA witness summons will not be issued until the applicant files written evidence showing that the application is made with -\n\n(1) the permission of the tribunal; or\n\n(2) the agreement of the other parties.\n\nInterim remedies\n\n8.1\n\nAn application for an interim remedy under section 44 of the 1996 Act must be made in an arbitration claim form.\n\nApplications under sections 32 and 45 of the 1996 Act\n\n---\n\n9.1\n\nThis paragraph applies to arbitration claims for the determination of -\n\n(1) a question as to the substantive jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal under section 32 of the 1996 Act; and\n\n(2) a preliminary point of law under section 45 of the 1996 Act.\n\n---\n\n9.2\n\nWhere an arbitration claim is made without the agreement in writing of all the other parties to the arbitral proceedings but with the permission of the arbitral tribunal, the written evidence or witness statements filed by the parties must set out any evidence relied on by the parties in support of their contention that the court should, or should not, consider the claim.\n\n---\n\n9.3\n\nAs soon as practicable after the written evidence is filed, the court will decide whether or not it should consider the claim and, unless the court otherwise directs, will so decide without a hearing.\n\nDecisions without a hearing\n\n---\n\n10.1\n\nHaving regard to the overriding objective the court may decide particular issues without a hearing. For example, as set out in paragraph 9.3, the question whether the court is satisfied as to the matters set out in section 32(2)(b) or section 45(2)(b) of the 1996 Act.\n\n---\n\n10.2\n\nThe court will generally decide whether to extend the time limit under section 70(3) of the 1996 Act without a hearing. Where the court makes an order extending the time limit, the defendant must file his written evidence within 21 days from service of the order.\n\n62.9 - Variation of time\n\n---\n\n11.1\n\nAn application for an order under rule 62.9(1) -\n\n(1) before the period of 28 days has expired, must be made in a Part 23 application notice; and\n\n(2) after the period of 28 days has expired, must be set out in a separately identified part in the arbitration claim form.\n\nApplications for permission to appeal\n\n---\n\n12.1\n\nWhere a party seeks permission to appeal to the court on a question of law arising out of an arbitration award, the arbitration claim form must, in addition to complying with rule 62.4(1) -\n\n(1) identify the question of law;\n\n(2) state the grounds (but not the argument) on which the party challenges the award and contends that permission should be given;\n\n(3) be accompanied by a skeleton argument in support of the application in accordance with paragraph 12.2; and\n\n(4) append the award.\n\n---\n\n12.2\n\nSubject to paragraph 12.3, the skeleton argument -\n\n(1) must be printed in 12 point font, with 1� line spacing;\n\n(2) should not exceed 15 pages in length; and\n\n(3) must contain an estimate of how long the court is likely to need to deal with the application on the papers.\n\n12.3\n\nIf the skeleton argument exceeds 15 pages in length the author must write to the court explaining why that is necessary.\n\n---\n\n12.4\n\nWritten evidence may be filed in support of the application only if it is necessary to show (insofar as that is not apparent from the award itself) -\n\n(1) that the determination of the question raised by the appeal will substantially affect the rights of one or more of the parties;\n\n(2) that the question is one which the tribunal was asked to determine;\n\n(3) that the question is one of general public importance;\n\n(4) that it is just and proper in all the circumstances for the court to determine the question raised by the appeal.\n\nAny such evidence must be filed and served with the arbitration claim form.\n\n---\n\n12.5\n\nUnless there is a dispute whether the question raised by the appeal is one which the tribunal was asked to determine, no arbitration documents may be put before the court other than -\n\n(1) the award; and\n\n(2) any document (such as the contract or the relevant parts thereof) which is referred to in the award and which the court needs to read to determine a question of law arising out of the award.\n\nIn this Practice Direction 'arbitration documents' means documents adduced in or produced for the purposes of the arbitration.\n\n---\n\n12.6\n\nA respondent who wishes to oppose an application for permission to appeal must file a respondent's notice which -\n\n(1) sets out the grounds (but not the argument) on which the respondent opposes the application; and\n\n(2) states whether the respondent wishes to contend that the award should be upheld for reasons not expressed (or not fully expressed) in the award and, if so, states those reasons (but not the argument).\n\n---\n\n12.7\n\nThe respondent's notice must be filed and served within 21 days after the date on which the respondent was required to acknowledge service and must be accompanied by a skeleton argument in support which complies with paragraph 12.2 above.\n\n12.8\n\nWritten evidence in opposition to the application should be filed only if it complies with the requirements of paragraph 12.4 above. Any such evidence must be filed and served with the respondent's notice.\n\n---\n\n12.9\n\nThe applicant may file and serve evidence or argument in reply only if it is necessary to do so. Any such evidence or argument must be as brief as possible and must be filed and served within 7 days after service of the respondent's notice.\n\n---\n\n12.10\n\nIf either party wishes to invite the court to consider arbitration documents other than those specified in paragraph 12.5 above the counsel or solicitor responsible for settling the application documents must write to the court explaining why that is necessary.\n\n12.11\n\nIf a party or its representative fails to comply with the requirements of paragraphs 12.1 to 12.9 the court may penalise that party or representative in costs.\n\n---\n\n12.12\n\nThe court will normally determine applications for permission to appeal without an oral hearing but may direct otherwise, particularly with a view to saving time (including court time) or costs.\n\n12.13\n\nWhere the court considers that an oral hearing is required, it may give such further directions as are necessary.\n\n12.14\n\nWhere the court refuses an application for permission to appeal without an oral hearing, it will provide brief reasons.\n\n---\n\n12.15\n\nThe bundle for the hearing of any appeal should contain only the claim form, the respondent's notice, the arbitration documents referred to in paragraph 12.5, the order granting permission to appeal and the skeleton arguments.\n\nSECTION II\n\n13.1\n\nThis Section of this Practice Direction applies to arbitration claims to which Section II of Part 62 applies.\n\n62.13 - Starting the claim\n\n---\n\n14.1\n\nAn arbitration claim must be started in the Commercial Court and, where required to be heard by a judge, be heard by a judge of that court unless he otherwise directs.\n\nSECTION III\n\n15.1\n\nThis Section of this Practice Direction applies to enforcement proceedings to which Section III of Part 62 applies.\n\n62.21 - Registration of awards under the Arbitration (International Investment Disputes) Act 1966\n\n---\n\n16.1\n\nAwards ordered to be registered under the 1966 Act and particulars will be entered in the Register kept for that purpose at the Admiralty and Commercial Registry.\n\nArbitration\n\nN 8 Claim form (arbitration)\n\nAvailable on theforms page.\n\nN 8 ANotes for claimant\n\nAvailable on theforms page.\n\nN 8 BNotes for defendant\n\nAvailable on theforms page.\n\nN 15 Acknowledgement of service (arbitration claim)\n\nAvailable on theforms page.",
