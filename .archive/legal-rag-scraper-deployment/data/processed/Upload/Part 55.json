Interpretation\n\n55.1 In this Part -\n\n(a) 'a possession claim' means a claim for the recovery of possession of land (including buildings or parts of buildings);\n\n(b) 'a possession claim against trespassers' means a claim for the recovery of land which the claimant alleges is occupied only by a person or persons who entered or remained on the land without the consent of a person entitled to possession of that land but does not include a claim against a tenant or sub-tenant whether his tenancy has been terminated or not;\n\n(c) 'mortgage' includes a legal or equitable mortgage and a legal or equitable charge and 'mortgagee' is to be interpreted accordingly;\n\n(d) 'the 1985 Act' means the Housing Act 19851;(e) 'the 1988 Act' means the Housing Act 19882;\n\n(f) 'a demotion claim' means a claim made by a landlord for an order under section 82 A of the 1985 Act or section 6 A of the 1988 Act ('a demotion order');\n\n(g) 'a demoted tenancy' means a tenancy created by virtue of a demotion order; and\n\n(h) 'a suspension claim' means a claim made by a landlord for an order under section 121 A of the 1985 Act.

Where the claim is a demotion claim or a suspension claim only, or a suspension claim made in addition to a demotion claim, Section III of Part 65 applies).\n\n(2) This Section of this Part\n\n(a) is subject to any enactment or practice direction which sets out special provisions with regard to any particular category of claim;\n\n(b) does not apply where the claimant uses the procedure set out in Section II of this Part; and\n\n(c) does not apply where the claimant seeks an interim possession order under Section III of this Part except where the court orders otherwise or that Section so provides.
