A claim for a remedy for harassment or unlawful eviction relating, in either case, to residential premises or to a dwelling where the claim is under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 shall not be allocated to the small claims track whatever the financial value of the claim. Otherwise, the small claims track will be the normal track for -\n\n• any claim which has a financial value of not more than £10,000 subject to the special provisions about claims for personal injuries and housing disrepair claims;\n• any claim for personal injuries which has a financial value of not more than £10,000 where the claim for damages for personal injuries is not more than the relevant value specified in rule 26.9(1)(a)(ii)(aa), (bb) or (cc), being £5,000, £1,000 or £1,500, respectively; and\n• any claim which includes a claim by a tenant of residential premises against his landlord for repairs or other work to the premises where the estimated cost of the repairs or other work is not more than £1,000 and the financial value of any other claim for damages is not more than £1,000);\n• any claim which includes a claim under the Renting Home (Wales) Act 2016 by a contract-holder of a dwelling against their landlord for repairs or other work to the dwelling where the estimated cost of the repairs or other work is not more than £1,000 and the financial value of any other claim for damages is not more than £1,000).\n\n---\n\nExtent to which other Parts apply\n\n27.2\n\n(1) The following Parts of these Rules do not apply to small claims -\n\n(a) Part 25 (interim remedies) except as it relates to interim injunctions(GL);\n\n(b) Part 31 (disclosure and inspection);\n\n(c) Part 32 (evidence) except rule 32.1 (power of court to control evidence);\n\n(d) Part 33 (miscellaneous rules about evidence);\n\n(e) Part 35 (experts and assessors) except rules 35.1 (duty to restrict expert evidence), 35.3 (experts - overriding duty to the court), 35.7 (court's power to direct that evidence is to be given by single joint expert) and 35.8 (instructions to a single joint expert);\n\n(f) Subject to paragraph (3), Part 18 (further information);\n\n(g) Part 36 (offers to settle);

and\n\n(b) disapply or modify any of the rules set out in this Part.\n\n(3) The court of its own initiative may order a party to provide further information if it considers it appropriate to do so.\n\n---\n\nCourt's power to grant a final remedy\n\n27.3 The court may grant any final remedy in relation to a small claim which it could grant if the proceedings were on the fast track, the intermediate track or the multi-track.\n\n---\n\nPreparation for the hearing\n\n27.4\n\n(1) After allocation the court will -\n\n(a) give standard directions and fix a date for the final hearing;\n\n(b) give special directions and fix a date for the final hearing;\n\n(c) give special directions and direct that the court will consider what further directions are to be given no later than 28 days after the date the special directions were given;\n\n(d) fix a date for a preliminary hearing under rule 27.6; or\n\n(e) give notice that it proposes to deal with the claim without a hearing under rule 27.10 and invite the parties to notify the court by a specified date if they agree the proposal.\n\n(2) The court will -\n\n(a) give the parties at least 21 days' notice of the date fixed for the final hearing, unless the parties agree to accept less notice; and\n\n(b) inform them of the amount of time allowed for the final hearing.\n\n(3) In this rule -\n\n(a) 'standard directions' means -\n\n(i) a direction that each party shall, at least 14 days before the date fixed for the final hearing, file and serve on every other party copies of all documents (including any expert's report) on which he intends to rely at the hearing; and\n\n(ii) any other standard directions set out in Practice Direction 27 A; and\n\n(b) 'special directions' means directions given in addition to or instead of the standard directions.\n\n---\n\nExperts\n\n27.5 No expert may give evidence, whether written or oral, at a hearing without the permission of the court.\n\n( Rule 27.14(3)(d) provides for the payment of an expert's fees)\n\n---\n\nPreliminary hearing\n\n27.6\n\n(1) The court may hold a preliminary hearing for the consideration of the claim, but only -\n\n(a) where -\n\n(i) it considers that special directions, as defined in rule 27.4, are needed to ensure a fair hearing; and\n\n(ii) it appears necessary for a party to attend at court to ensure that he understands what he must do to comply with the special directions; or\n\n(b) to enable it to dispose of the claim on the basis that one or other of the parties has no real prospect of success at a final hearing; or\n\n(c) to enable it to strike out(GL)a statement of case or part of a statement of case on the basis that the statement of case, or the part to be struck out, discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim.\n\n(2) When considering whether or not to hold a preliminary hearing, the court must have regard to the desirability of limiting the expense to the parties of attending court.\n\n(3) Where the court decides to hold a preliminary hearing, it will give the parties at least 14 days' notice of the date of the hearing.\n\n(4) The court may treat the preliminary hearing as the final hearing of the claim if all the parties agree.\n\n(5) At or after the preliminary hearing the court will-\n\n(a) fix the date of the final hearing (if it has not been fixed already) and give the parties at least 21 days' notice of the date fixed unless the parties agree to accept less notice;\n\n(b) inform them of the amount of time allowed for the final hearing;

and\n\n(c) has, in his written notice, requested the court to decide the claim in his absence and has confirmed his compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) above,\n\nthe court will take into account that party's statement of case and any other documents he has filed and served when it decides the claim.\n\n(2) If a claimant does not -\n\n(a) attend the hearing; and\n\n(b) give the notice referred to in paragraph (1),\n\nthe court may strike out(GL)the claim.\n\n(3) If -\n\n(a) a defendant does not -\n\n(i) attend the hearing; or\n\n(ii) give the notice referred to in paragraph (1);

and\n\n(h) the applicable Stage 1 and, where relevant, the Stage 2 fixed costs in Table 10 and Table 11 in Practice Direction 45 where -\n\n(i) the claim was within the scope of the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents ('the RTA Protocol') or the Pre-action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury (Employers' Liability and Public Liability) Claims ('the EL/PL Protocol');\n\n(ii) the claimant reasonably believed that the claim was valued at more than the small claims track limit in accordance with paragraph 4.1(4) of the relevant Protocol; and\n\n(iii) the defendant admitted liability under the process set out in the relevant Protocol; but\n\n(iv) the defendant did not pay those Stage 1 and, where relevant, Stage 2 fixed costs; and\n\n(i) in an appeal, the cost of any approved transcript reasonably incurred.\n\n(3) A party's rejection of an offer in settlement will not of itself constitute unreasonable behaviour under paragraph (2)(g) but the court may take it into consideration when it is applying the unreasonableness test.\n\n(4) The limits on costs imposed by this rule also apply to any fee or reward for acting on behalf of a party to the proceedings charged by a person exercising a right of audience by virtue of an order under section 11 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 19901(a lay representative).\n\n---\n\nClaim re-allocated from the small claims track to another track\n\n27.15\n\n(1) Where a claim is allocated to the small claims track and subsequently re-allocated to another track, the costs which may be allowed are those applicable to the track to which the claim is reallocated, as if the claim been allocated to that track at the outset.\n\n(2) Where a claim is reallocated to the small claims track from the multi-track, rule 27.14 shall apply to the period before, as well as after, reallocation, except where a court order or a rule or practice direction provides otherwise.\n\n---\n\nFootnotes\n\n• 1990 c.41.",
