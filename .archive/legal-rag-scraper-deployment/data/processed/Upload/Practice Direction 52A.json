Such an appeal may only be allocated to a Recorder in exceptional circumstances.\n\n---\n\nApplications within appeals to the High Court and within the County Court\n\n4.5 A\n\n(1) Where the appeal is an appeal to the High Court or within the County Court, any judge who may hear the appeal, could be authorised to hear the appeal or to whom the appeal could be allocated may-\n\n(a) hear any application made within the appeal, including an application for a stay but excluding an application for permission to appeal; and\n\n(b) give directions in the appeal.\n\n(2) In addition, where the appeal is to the High Court and is from the decision of a Circuit Judge sitting in the County Court, a Group C Judge may-\n\n(a) hear any application made within the appeal, including an application for a stay but excluding an application for permission to appeal; and\n\n(b) give directions in the appeal.\n\n---\n\nAppeal in relation to case management decision\n\n4.6 Where the application is for permission to appeal from a case management decision, the court dealing with the application may take into account whether -\n\n(a) the issue is of sufficient significance to justify the costs of an appeal;\n\n(b) the procedural consequences of an appeal (e.g. loss of trial date) outweigh the significance of the case management decision;\n\n(c) it would be more convenient to determine the issue at or after trial.\n\nCase management decisions include decisions made under rule 3.1(2) and decisions about disclosure, filing of witness statements or experts' reports, directions about the timetable of the claim, adding a party to a claim and security for costs.\n\n---\n\nSecond appeal\n\n4.7 Unless paragraph 4.8 applies an application for permission to appeal from a decision of the High Court or a county court which was itself made on appeal is a second appeal and must be made to the Court of Appeal. If permission to appeal is granted the appeal will be heard by the Court of Appeal.\n\n4.8 Where in contempt proceedings the first appeal is determined by the Divisional Court or a single judge of the High Court a second appeal lies to the Supreme Court with permission.\n\n---\n\nSECTION V - SKELETON ARGUMENTS\n\n5.1\n\n(1) The purpose of a skeleton argument is to assist the court by setting out as concisely as practicable the arguments upon which a party intends to rely.\n\n(2) A skeleton argument must-\n\n• be concise;\n• both define and confine the areas of controversy;\n• be set out in numbered paragraphs;\n• be cross-referenced to any relevant document in the bundle;\n• be self-contained and not incorporate by reference material from previous skeleton arguments;\n• not include extensive quotations from documents or authorities.\n\n(3) Documents to be relied on must be identified.\n\n(4) Where it is necessary to refer to an authority, a skeleton argument must -\n\n(a) state the proposition of law the authority demonstrates; and\n\n(b) identify the parts of the authority that support the proposition.\n\nIf more than one authority is cited in support of a given proposition, the skeleton argument must briefly state why.\n\n(5) The cost of preparing a skeleton argument which -\n\n(a) does not comply with the requirements set out in this paragraph; or\n\n(b) was not filed within the time limits provided by this Practice Direction (or any further time granted by the court),\n\nwill not be allowed on assessment except as directed by the court.\n\n5.2 The parties should consider what other information the appeal court will need. This may include a list of persons who feature in the case or glossaries of technical terms. A chronology of relevant events will be necessary in most appeals.\n\n5.3 Any statement of costs must show the amount claimed for the skeleton argument separately.\n\n---\n\nSECTION VI - DISPOSING OF APPLICATIONS AND APPEALS BY CONSENT\n\n---\n\nDismissal of applications or appeals by consent\n\n6.1 An appellant who does not wish to pursue an application or appeal may request the appeal court to dismiss the application or the appeal. If such a request is granted it will usually be subject to an order that the appellant pays the costs of the application or appeal.\n\n6.2 If the appellant wishes to have the application or appeal dismissed without costs, his request must be accompanied by a letter signed by the respondent stating that the respondent so consents.\n\n6.3 Where a settlement has been reached disposing of the application or appeal, the parties may make a joint request to the court for the application or appeal to be dismissed by consent. If the request is granted the application or appeal will be dismissed.\n\n---\n\nAllowing unopposed appeals or applications on paper\n\n6.4 The appeal court will not normally make an order allowing an appeal unless satisfied that the decision of the lower court was wrong or unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity. The appeal court may, however, set aside or vary the order of the lower court by consent and without determining the merits of the appeal if it is satisfied that there are good and sufficient reasons for so doing. Where the appeal court is requested by all parties to allow an application or an appeal the court may consider the request on the papers. The request should set out the relevant history of the proceedings and the matters relied on as justifying the order and be accompanied by a draft order.\n\n---\n\nDisposal of applications and appeals involving children or protected parties\n\n6.5 Where one of the parties is a child or protected party, any disposal of an application or the appeal requires the court's approval. A draft order signed by the parties' solicitors should be sent to the appeal court, together with an opinion from the advocate acting on behalf of the child or protected party and, in the case of a protected party, any relevant documents prepared for the Court of Protection.\n\n---\n\nSECTION VII - REOPENING APPEALS (RULE 52.30)\n\n7.1 A party applying for permission to reopen an appeal or an application for permission to appeal must apply for such permission from the court whose decision the party wishes to reopen.\n\n7.2 The application for permission must be made by application notice and be supported by written evidence, verified by a statement of truth. A copy of the application for permission must not be served on any other party to the original appeal unless the court so directs.\n\n7.3 Where the court directs that the application for permission is to be served on another party, that party may, within 14 days of the service on him of the copy of the application, file and serve a written statement either supporting or opposing the application.\n\n7.4 The application for permission will be considered on paper by a single judge.\n\n---\n\nSECTION VIII - TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n8.1 This Practice Direction and Practice Directions 52 B, 52 C, 52 D and 52 E shall come into force on 1 October 2012 and shall apply to all appeals where -\n\n(a) the appeal notice was filed; or\n\n(b) permission to appeal was given\n\non or after that date.\n\n8.2 The appeal court may at any time direct that, in relation to any appeal, one or more of Practice Directions 52 A, 52 B, 52 C, 52 D or 52 E shall apply irrespective of the date on which the appeal notice was filed or permission to appeal was given.",
