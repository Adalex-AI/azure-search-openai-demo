but\n\n(b) if the appropriate Minister does not do so, at a hearing on notice, the court may -\n\n(i) where it considers that the material or anything that is required to be summarised might adversely affect the appropriate Minister's case or supports the case of the specially represented party, direct that the appropriate Minister must not rely on such material in the appropriate Minister's case, or must make such concessions or take such other steps, as the court may specify; or\n\n(ii) in any other case, direct that the appropriate Minister does not rely on the material or (as the case may be) on that which is required to be summarised.\n\n---\n\nFailure to comply with directions\n\n---\n\n79.27\n\n(1) Where a party or special advocate fails to comply with a direction of the court, the court may serve on that party or the special advocate a notice which states -\n\n(a) the respect in which that party or special advocate has failed to comply with the direction;\n\n(b) a time limit for complying with the direction; and\n\n(c) that the court may proceed to determine the proceedings before it, on the material available to it, if the party or special advocate fails to comply with the relevant direction within the time specified.\n\n(2) Where a party or special advocate fails to comply with such a notice, the court may proceed in accordance with paragraph (1)(c).\n\n---\n\nJudgments\n\n---\n\n79.28\n\n(1) When the court gives judgment in any proceedings to which Section 2 or 3 of this Part applies, it may withhold all or some of its reasons if and to the extent that it is not possible to give reasons without disclosing information contrary to the public interest.\n\n(2) Where the judgment of the court does not include the full reasons for its decision, the court will serve on the appropriate Minister and the special advocate a separate written judgment including those reasons.\n\n(3) Where the court serves a separate written judgment under paragraph (2), the special advocate may apply to the court to amend that judgment and the judgment under paragraph (1) on the grounds that the separate written judgment under paragraph (2) contains material not in the judgment under paragraph (1) the disclosure of which would not be contrary to the public interest.\n\n(4) The special advocate must serve a copy of the application under paragraph (3) on the appropriate Minister.\n\n(5) The court will give the special advocate and the appropriate Minister an opportunity to file written submissions and may determine the application with or without a hearing.\n\n---\n\nApplication by the appropriate Minister for reconsideration of order, direction or judgment\n\n---\n\n79.29\n\n(1) This rule applies where the court proposes, in any proceedings to which Section 2 or 3 of this Part applies, to serve on a party other than the appropriate Minister -\n\n(a) notice of any order or direction made or given in the absence of the appropriate Minister; or\n\n(b) any written judgment.\n\n(2) Before the court serves any such notice or judgment on a party other than the appropriate Minister it will first serve notice on the appropriate Minister of its intention to do so.\n\n(3) The appropriate Minister may, within 5 days of being served with notice under paragraph (2), apply to the court to reconsider the terms of the order or direction or to review the terms of the proposed judgment if the appropriate Minister considers -\n\n(a) the appropriate Minister's compliance with the order or direction; or\n\n(b) the notification to another party of any matter contained in the judgment, order or direction,\n\nwould cause information to be disclosed contrary to the public interest.\n\n(4) Where the appropriate Minister makes an application under paragraph (3), the appropriate Minister must at the same time serve on a special advocate, if one has been appointed -\n\n(a) a copy of the application;\n\n(b) a copy of the relevant document referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (b); and\n\n(c) a copy of the notice served on the appropriate Minister pursuant to paragraph (2).\n\n(5) If a special advocate has been appointed, rule 79.26 (except for paragraphs (6) and (7)) will apply with any necessary modifications to the consideration of an application under paragraph (3) of this rule.\n\n(6) The court will not serve notice on a party other than the appropriate Minister as mentioned in paragraph (1) before the time for the appropriate Minister to make an application under paragraph (3) has expired.\n\n---\n\nSupply of court documents\n\n79.30\n\nUnless the court directs otherwise, rule 5.4 (Register of Claims), rule 5.4 B (Supply of documents from court records - a party) and rule 5.4 C (Supply of documents from court records -a non-party) do not apply to any proceedings to which Section 2 or 3 of this Part applies or to any document relating to such proceedings.\n\nV NOTIFICATION ORDERS\n\nApplications for a notification order\n\n---\n\n79.31\n\n(1) An application for a notification order under Schedule 4 to the 2008 Act must be made in accordance with Part 8.\n\n(2) Where the defendant wishes to serve a notice under paragraph 2(4) of Schedule 4 to the 2008 Act, the defendant must file and serve the notice with an acknowledgment of service not more than 14 days after service of the claim form.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. 2008 c.28.Return to footnote 1\n\n2. 2001 c.24.Return to footnote 2",
