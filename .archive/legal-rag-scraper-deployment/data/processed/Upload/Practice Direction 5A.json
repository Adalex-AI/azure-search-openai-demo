This may be done by a seal or a receipt stamp.\n\n5.2 Particulars of the date of delivery at a court office of any document for filing and the title of the proceedings in which the document is filed shall be entered in court records, on the court file or on a computer kept in the court office for the purpose. Except where a document has been delivered at the court office through the post, the time of delivery should also be recorded.\n\n5.3 Filing by Facsimile\n\n(1) Subject to paragraph (6) below, a party may file a document at court by sending it by facsimile ('fax').\n\n(2) Where a party files a document by fax, he must not send a hard copy in addition.\n\n(3) A party filing a document by fax should be aware that the document is not filed at court until it is delivered by the court's fax machine, whatever time it is shown to have been transmitted from the party's machine.\n\n(4) The time of delivery of the faxed document will be recorded on it in accordance with paragraph 5.2.\n\n(5) It remains the responsibility of the party to ensure that the document is delivered to the court in time.\n\n(6) If a fax is delivered after 4 p.m. it will be treated as filed on the next day the court office is open.\n\n(7) If a fax relates to a hearing, the date and time of the hearing should be prominently displayed.\n\n(8) Fax should not be used to send letters or documents of a routine or non-urgent nature.\n\n(9) Fax should not be used, except in an unavoidable emergency, to deliver:\n\n(a) a document which attracts a fee\n\n(b) omitted\n\n(c) a document relating to a hearing less than two hours ahead\n\n(d) trial bundles or skeleton arguments\n\n(10) Where (9)(a) applies, the fax should give an explanation for the emergency and include an undertaking that the fee or money has been dispatched that day by post or will be paid at the court office counter the following business day.\n\n(11) Where courts have several fax machines, each allocated to an individual section, fax messages should only be sent to the machine of the section for which the message is intended.\n\n5.4 Where the Court orders any document to be lodged in Court, the document must, unless otherwise directed, be deposited in the appropriate office of that Court.\n\n5.5 A document filed, lodged or held in any court office shall not be taken out of that office without the permission of the Court unless the document is to be sent to another court office (for example under CPR Part 30 (Transfer)), except in accordance with CPR rule 39.7 (impounded documents) or in accordance with paragraph 5.6 below.\n\n5.6\n\n(1) Where a document filed, lodged or held in a court office is required to be produced to any Court, Tribunal or arbitrator, the document may be produced by sending it by registered post (together with a Certificate as in paragraph 5.6(8)(b)) to the Court, Tribunal or arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.\n\n(2) Any Court, Tribunal or arbitrator or any party requiring any document filed, lodged or held in any court office to be produced must apply to that court office by sending a completed request (as in paragraph 5.6 (8)(a)), stamped with the prescribed fee.\n\n(3) On receipt of the request the court officer will submit the same to a Master in the Royal Courts of Justice or to a District Judge elsewhere, who may direct that the request be complied with. Before giving a direction the Master or District Judge may require to be satisfied that the request is made in good faith and that the document is required to be produced for the reasons stated. The Master or District Judge giving the direction may also direct that, before the document is sent, an official copy of it is made and filed in the court office at the expense of the party requiring the document to be produced.\n\n(4) On the direction of the Master or District Judge the court officer shall send the document by registered post addressed to the Court, Tribunal or arbitrator, with:\n\n(a) an envelope stamped and addressed for use in returning the document to the court office from which it was sent;\n\n(b) a Certificate as in paragraph 5.6(8)(b);\n\n(c) a covering letter describing the document, stating at whose request and for what purpose it is sent, referring to this paragraph of the Practice Direction and containing a request that the document be returned to the court office from which it was sent in the enclosed envelope as soon as the Court or Tribunal no longer requires it.\n\n(5) It shall be the duty of the Court, Tribunal or arbitrator to whom the document was sent to keep it in safe custody, and to return it by registered post to the court office from which it was sent, as soon as the Court, Tribunal or arbitrator no longer requires it.\n\n(6) In each court office a record shall be kept of each document sent and the date on which it was sent and the Court, Tribunal or arbitrator to whom it was sent and the date of its return. It shall be the duty of the court officer who has signed the certificate referred to in para 5.6(8)(b) below to ensure that the document is returned within a reasonable time and to make inquiries and report to the Master or District Judge who has given the direction under paragraph (3) above if the document is not returned, so that steps may be taken to secure its return.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, the Master or District Judge may direct a court officer to attend the Court, Tribunal or arbitrator for the purpose of producing the document.\n\n(8)\n\n(a) I, of , an officer of the Court/Tribunal at /an arbitrator of /the Claimant /Defendant /Solicitor for the Claimant/ Defendant [describing the Applicant so as to show that he is a proper person to make the request] in the case of v.
