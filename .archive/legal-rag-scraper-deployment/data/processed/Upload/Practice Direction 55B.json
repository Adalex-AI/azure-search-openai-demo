These may include requiring users of Possession Claims Online -\n\n(1) to enter a customer identification number or password;\n\n(2) to provide personal information for identification purposes; and\n\n(3) to comply with any other security measures,\n\nbefore taking any step online.\n\n---\n\nFees\n\n4.1 A step may only be taken using Possession Claims Online on payment of the prescribed fee where a fee is payable. Where this practice direction provides for a fee to be paid electronically, it may be paid by -\n\n(1) credit card;\n\n(2) debit card; or\n\n(3) any other method which HM Courts and Tribunals Service may permit.\n\n4.2 A defendant who wishes to claim exemption from payment of fees must do so through an organisation approved by HM Courts and Tribunals Service before taking any step using PCOL which attracts a fee. If satisfied that the defendant is entitled to fee exemption, the organisation will submit the fee exemption form through the PCOL website to HM Courts and Tribunals Service. The defendant may then use PCOL to take such a step.\n\n(HM Courts and Tribunals Service website contains guidance as to when the entitlement to claim an exemption from payment of fees arises. The PCOL website will contain a list of organisations through which the defendant may claim an exemption from fees).\n\n---\n\nClaims which may be started using Possession Claims Online\n\n5.1 A claim may be started online if -\n\n(1) it is brought under Sections I or IV of Part 55;\n\n(2) it includes a possession claim for residential property or a Renting Homes possession claim by -\n\n(a) a landlord against a tenant or contract holder, solely on the ground of arrears of rent (but not a claim for forfeiture of a lease); or\n\n(b) a mortgagee against a mortgagor, solely on the ground of default in the payment of sums due under a mortgage,\n\nrelating to land the address for which is served by a County Court hearing centre;\n\n(3) it does not include a claim for any other remedy except for payment of arrears of rent or money due under a mortgage, interest and costs;\n\n(3 A) the claimant has an address for service in the United Kingdom;\n\n(4) the defendant has an address for service in England and Wales; and\n\n(5) the claimant is able to provide a postcode for the property.\n\n5.2 A claim must not be started online if a defendant is known to be a child or protected party.\n\n---\n\nStarting a claim\n\n6.1 A claimant may request the issue of a claim form by-\n\n(1) completing an online claim form at the PCOL website;\n\n(2) paying the appropriate issue fee electronically at the PCOL website or by some other means approved by HM Courts and Tribunals Service.\n\n6.2 The particulars of claim must be included in the online claim form and may not be filed separately.

The acknowledgment does not constitute notice that the claim form has been issued or served.\n\n6.6 When the court issues a claim form following the submission of an online claim form, the claim is 'brought' for the purposes of the Limitation Act 1980 and any other enactment on the date on which the online claim form is received by the court's computer system. The court will keep a record, by electronic or other means, of when online claim forms are received.\n\n6.7 When the court issues a claim form it will -\n\n(1) serve a printed version of the claim form and a defence form on the defendant; and\n\n(2) send the claimant notice of issue by post or, where the claimant has supplied an e-mail address, by electronic means.\n\n6.8 The claim shall be deemed to be served on the fifth day after the claim was issued irrespective of whether that day is a business day or not.\n\n6.9 Where the period of time within which a defence must be filed ends on a day when the court is closed, the defendant may file his defence on the next day that the court is open.\n\n6.10 The claim form shall have printed on it a unique customer identification number or a password by which the defendant may access the claim on the PCOL website.\n\n6.11 PCOL will issue the proceedings in the appropriate County Court hearing centre by reference to the post code provided by the claimant and that court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim and to carry out enforcement of any judgment irrespective of whether the property is within or outside the jurisdiction of that court.\n\n(CPR 30.2(1) authorises proceedings to be transferred from one County Court to another.)\n\n---\n\nDefence\n\n7.1 A defendant wishing to file -\n\n(1) a defence; or\n\n(2) a counterclaim (to be filed together with a defence) to a claim which has been issued through the PCOL system,\n\nmay, instead of filing a written form, do so by -\n\n(a) completing the relevant online form at the PCOL website; and\n\n(b) if the defendant is making a counterclaim, paying the appropriate fee electronically at the PCOL website or by some other means approved by HM Courts and Tribunals Service.\n\n7.2 Where a defendant files a defence by completing the relevant online form, he must not send the court a hard copy.\n\n7.3 When an online defence form is received, an acknowledgment of receipt will automatically be sent to the defendant. The acknowledgment does not constitute notice that the defence has been served.\n\n7.4 The online defence form will be treated as being filed -\n\n(1) on the day the court receives it, if it receives it before 4 p.m. on a working day; and\n\n(2) otherwise, on the next working day after the court receives the online defence form.\n\n7.5 A defence is filed when the online defence form is received by the court's computer system. The court will keep a record, by electronic or other means, of when online defence forms are received.\n\n---\n\nStatement of truth\n\n8.1 CPR Part 22 requires any statement of case to be verified by a statement of truth. This applies to any online claims and defences and application notices.\n\n8.2 CPR Part 22 also requires that if an applicant wishes to rely on matters set out in his application notice as evidence, the application notice must be verified by a statement of truth. This applies to any application notice completed online that contains matters on which the applicant wishes to rely as evidence.\n\n8.3 Attention is drawn to -\n\n(1) paragraph 2 of Practice Direction 22, which stipulates the form of the statement of truth; and\n\n(2) rule 22.1(6) and paragraph 3 of Practice Direction 22, which provides who may sign a statement of truth; and\n\n(3) CPR 32.14, which sets out the consequences of making, or causing to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth, without an honest belief in its truth.\n\n---\n\nSignature\n\n9.1 Any provision of the CPR which requires a document to be signed by any person is satisfied by that person entering his name on an online form.\n\n---\n\nCommunication with the court electronically by the messaging service\n\n10.1 If the PCOL website specifies that a court accepts electronic communications relating to claims brought using Possession Claims Online the parties may communicate with the court using the messaging service facility, available on the PCOL website ('the messaging service').\n\n10.2 The messaging service is for brief and straightforward communications only. The PCOL website contains a list of examples of when it will not be appropriate to use the messaging service.\n\n10.3 Parties must not send to the court forms or attachments via the messaging service.\n\n10.4 The court shall treat any forms or attachments sent via the messaging service as not having been filed or received.\n\n10.5 The court will normally reply via the messaging service where -\n\n(1) the response is to a message transmitted via the messaging service; and\n\n(2) the sender has provided an e-mail address.\n\n---\n\nElectronic applications\n\n11.1 Certain applications in relation to a possession claim or Renting Homes possession claim started online may be made electronically ('online applications').

The acknowledgment does not constitute a notice that the online application form has been issued or served.\n\n11.4 Where an application must be made within a specified time, it is so made if the online application form is received by the court's computer system within that time. The court will keep a record, by electronic or other means, of when online application forms are received.\n\n11.5 When the court receives an online application form it shall -\n\n(1) serve a copy of the online application endorsed with the date of the hearing by post on the claimant at least two clear days before the hearing; and\n\n(2) send the defendant notice of service and confirmation of the date of the hearing by post; provided that\n\n(3) where either party has provided the court with an e-mail address for service, service of the application and/or the notice of service and confirmation of the hearing date may be effected by electronic means.\n\n---\n\nRequest for issue of warrant\n\n12.1 Where -\n\n(1) the court has made an order for possession in a claim started online; and\n\n(2) the claimant is entitled to the issue of a warrant of possession without requiring the permission of the court\n\nthe claimant may request the issue of a warrant by completing an online request form at the PCOL website and paying the appropriate fee electronically at the PCOL website or by some other means approved by HM Courts and Tribunals Service.\n\n12.2 A request under paragraph 12.1 will be treated as being filed -\n\n(1) on the day the court receives the request, if it receives it before 4 p.m. on a working day; and\n\n(2) otherwise, on the next working day after the court receives the request.\n\n(Rule 83.2 sets out certain circumstances in which a warrant of possession may not be issued without the permission of the court.)\n\n---\n\nApplication to suspend warrant of possession\n\n13.1 Where the court has issued a warrant of possession, the defendant may apply electronically for the suspension of the warrant, provided that:\n\n(1) the application is made at least five clear days before the appointment for possession; and\n\n(2) the defendant is not prevented from making such an application without the permission of the court.\n\n13.2 The defendant may apply electronically for the suspension of the warrant, by -\n\n(1) completing an online application for suspension at the PCOL website; and\n\n(2) paying the appropriate fee electronically at the PCOL website or by some other means approved by HM Courts and Tribunals Service.\n\n13.3 When an online application for suspension is received, an acknowledgment of receipt will automatically be sent to the defendant.
