assessment proceedings but that party may apply for an order in respect of that representation under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act.\n\n(3) In deciding whether to make some other order, the court must have regard to all the circumstances, including -\n\n(a) the conduct of all the parties;\n\n(b) the amount, if any, by which the bill of costs has been reduced; and\n\n(c) whether it was reasonable

detailed assessment, and references to a 'judgment' being advantageous or otherwise are to the outcome of the detailed assessment.\n\n(5) The court will usually summarily assess the costs of detailed assessment proceedings at the conclusion of those proceedings.\n\n(6) Unless the court otherwise orders, interest on the costs of detailed assessment proceedings will run from the date of default,
