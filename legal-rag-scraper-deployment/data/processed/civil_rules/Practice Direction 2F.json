If they are so marked, then normally the Judge will be prepared to hear the application or appeal in August, if marked 'fit for August' or in September if marked 'fit for vacation'. A request to have the papers so marked should normally be made in writing, briefly setting out the nature of the application or appeal and the reasons why it should be dealt with in August or in September, as the case may be.\n\n---\n\nChancery Masters\n\n2.4 There is no distinction between term time and vacation so far as business before the Chancery Masters is concerned. The Masters will deal with all types of business throughout the year, and when a Master is on holiday his list will normally be taken by a Deputy Master.\n\n---\n\nKing's Bench Masters\n\n2.5\n\n(1) An application notice may, without permission, be made to a Master in the month of August for any of the following purposes:\n\nto set aside a claim form or particulars of claim, or service of a claim form or particulars of claim;\n\nto set aside judgment; for stay of execution;\n\nfor any order by consent;\n\nfor judgment or permission to enter judgment;\n\nfor approval of settlements or for interim payment;\n\nfor relief from forfeiture; for charging order; for third party debtor order;\n\nfor appointment or discharge of a receiver;\n\nfor relief by way of interpleader by a sheriff or High Court enforcement officer;\n\nfor transfer to a county court or for trial by Master;\n\nfor time where time is running in the month of August;\n\n(2) In any case of urgency any other type of application notice (that is other than those for the purposes in (1) above), may, with the permission of a Master be made to a Master during the month of August.",
