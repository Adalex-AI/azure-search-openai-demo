It is not a detailed note of the powers under the 1998 Act which are subject to interpretation by the courts. Subject matter and powers\n\nOfficers of the Competition and Markets Authority ('the CMA') [[if the Judge so orders pursuant to section 28(3 A) of the 1998 Act, insert the following here and elsewhere as indicated] and other persons] have been authorised under Warrant to enter and search the premises identified in the Warrant in connection with an [delete as appropriate: [an investigation under the 1998 Act][a request for assistance from an overseas regulator under Chapter 2 of Part 5 of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (\"the 2024 Act\") (provision of investigative assistance to overseas regulators)]]. The subject matter of this investigation is set out in paragraph 2 of the Warrant. The officers [and other persons] will not elaborate on this.\n\nParagraph 4 of the Warrant sets out the powers of the named officer 2 aand other officers [and other persons] under section 28 of the 1998 Act for the purposes of the present investigation. On entering the premises, the named officer will, as a matter of practice, produce evidence of the identity of the other officers in addition to his identity when producing the Warrant.\n\nUnless the Court has ordered otherwise, the initial production of the Warrant and entry to premises must take place between 9.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. Monday to Friday and, once officers [and other persons] have entered premises under the authority of the Warrant, they may outside those times and whilst the Warrant remains in force, remain on the premises or re-enter the premises to continue executing the Warrant. Access to legal advice\n\nYou are advised to seek legal advice. If the named officer and other officers consider it reasonable in the circumstances to do so and if they are satisfied that you are complying with, or will comply with, such conditions as they consider it appropriate to impose, the named officer and other officers will grant a request to allow a reasonable time for your legal adviser to arrive at the premises before the inspection continues.\n\nIf you decide to seek legal advice you should do so promptly and this must not unduly delay or impede the inspection. Any delay must be kept to a strict minimum.\n\nIf you have an in-house legal adviser on the premises, or if you have received prior notice of the inspection, the named officer and other officers [and other persons] will not wait for your external legal adviser to arrive. Self-incrimination\n\nThe named officer and other officers [and other persons] have powers, among other matters, to search and take copies of, or extracts from, documents covered by the Warrant, to require you to produce information which is stored in any electronic form and to require you to provide an explanation of any such documents (which the 1998 Act defines as including information recorded in any form). However, if your undertaking is suspected of having committed an infringement of the 1998 Act, they cannot require you to provide answers or statements that might involve an admission on your part of the existence of that infringement. If your undertaking is suspected of having committed a breach of the law in the country or territory of the overseas regulator named in paragraph 1 of the Warrant, the CMA expects to take the same approach to self-incrimination.\n\nYou should note also that, any statement made by a person in response to a requirement imposed by the named officer or other officers [or other persons] in exercise of their powers under paragraph 4 of the Warrant, may not be used in evidence against him on a prosecution for an offence under section 188 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the cartel offence) unless, in the proceedings -\n\n• in giving evidence, he makes a statement inconsistent with it, and\n• evidence relating to it is adduced, or a question relating to it is asked, by him or on his behalf. Legally privileged communications\n\nThe powers under section 28 of the 1998 Act to search, take copies etc. (set out in paragraph 4(b) onwards in the Warrant) do not apply in respect of any 'privileged communication'. This is defined in section 30 of the 1998 Act to mean a communication\n\n• between a professional legal adviser and his client, or\n• made in connection with, or in contemplation of, legal proceedings and for the purposes of those proceedings,\n\nwhich would be protected from disclosure in proceedings in the High Court on grounds of legal professional privilege.\n\nFor the purposes of section 30 of the 1998 Act, a 'professional legal adviser' includes both an external and an in-house qualified legal adviser.\n\nIf you consider that a document or information is privileged, you should provide the named officer or other officer [or other person] with material of such a nature as to demonstrate to his satisfaction that the document or information, or parts of it, for which privilege is claimed, fulfil the conditions for it being privileged.\n\nIf you fail to do so, you should gather together the items for which privilege is claimed. These items will not be examined or copied unless you reach an agreement with the named officer that they may be examined or copied. If no agreement is reached on the day of the inspection, the named officer will request that you make a copy of the items and place this in a sealed envelope or package in his presence. The named officer will then discuss with you appropriate arrangements for the safe-keeping of these items pending resolution of the issue of privilege. For example, such arrangements may include a request that your legal adviser should give (or if no legal adviser is present, that you give), a written undertaking that the envelope or package will be retained safely and that its contents will not be concealed, removed, tampered with or destroyed until the issue of privilege is resolved. Listing of items\n\nUnless it is impracticable in all the circumstances, no item may be removed from the premises by the named officer or other officers [or other persons] until they have prepared a list of all the items to be removed, a copy of the list has been supplied to you, and you have been given a reasonable opportunity to check that the list relates to all the items concerned, and only to those items. This does not entitle you or your legal adviser to insist that the list or its contents should take any particular form. Confidentiality\n\nYou should note that, subject to the safeguards in relation to self-incrimination and legal privilege, you arenotentitled to withhold a document or information by claiming that it is confidential.\n\nWhere it is possible to do so, it is suggested that after the inspection on the premises you should identify any part or parts of any information or document copied or taken that you consider to be confidential and provide a written explanation as to why it should be treated as such. For these purposes information is confidential if it is:\n\n• commercial information the disclosure of which would, or might, significantly harm the legitimate business interests of the undertaking to which it relates; or\n• information relating to the private affairs of an individual the disclosure of which would, or might, significantly harm his interests 2.\n\nA document will be treated as confidential to the extent that it contains confidential information.\n\nIt is for the CMA to determine whether or not the information is to be disclosed in accordance with Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002. Application to vary or discharge the Warrant\n\nYou are entitled to apply to the Court to vary or discharge the Warrant. If you intend to make such an application, you must first inform the named officer. An application to stop the Warrant from being executed must be made immediately upon it being served.\n\nThe application must be made to the judge who issued the Warrant, or if he is not available, to another High Court judge.\n\nIf you are making an immediate application to stop the Warrant from being executed, the named officer will delay starting or continuing a search of the premises for a reasonable period (not exceeding two hours) while you make your application, provided that you\n\n• permit the named officer and other officers [and other persons] to enter and remain on the premises;\n• keep the named officer informed of the steps you are taking in relation to the application; and\n• comply with any other conditions that the named officer imposes.\n\nExamples of conditions that the named officer may impose pursuant to (3) above include: that you do not disturb or move any document or information that is the subject of the Warrant; and/or you do not tell anyone other than your legal adviser about the Warrant or the investigation. Application under section 59 Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001\n\nYour attention is drawn to section 59 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which makes provision about applications relating to property seized in the exercise of the powers conferred by (among other provisions) section 28(2) of the 1998 Act.\n\nAn application under section 59 -\n\n• must be made by application notice in accordance with Part 23 of the Civil Procedure Rules; and\n• should be made to a judge of the Chancery Division at the Royal Courts of Justice (if available).\n\nWarrant (PDF - opens in new window) Explanatory Note to Warrant under section 75 of the Digital Markets Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (\"the 2024 Act\")\n\nThis Explanatory Note is provided for information only. It is not a detailed note of the powers under the 2024 Act which are subject to interpretation by the courts. Subject matter and powers\n\nOfficers of the Competition and Markets Authority ('the CMA') [[if the Judge so orders pursuant to section 75(4) of the 2024 Act, [insert the following here and elsewhere as indicated] and other persons] have been authorised under Warrant to enter and search the premises identified in the Warrant [delete as appropriate]: [for the purposes of a breach investigation under the 2024 Act][in connection with a request for assistance from an overseas regulator under Chapter 2 of Part 5 of the 2024 Act (provision of investigative assistance to overseas regulators)]]. The subject matter of this investigation is set out in paragraph 2 of the Warrant. The officers [and other persons] will not elaborate on this.\n\nParagraph 4 of the Warrant sets out the powers of the named officer[1] and other officers [and other persons] under section 75 of the 2024 Act for the purposes of the present investigation. On entering the premises, the named officer will, as a matter of practice, produce evidence of the identity of the other officers in addition to his identity when producing the Warrant.\n\nUnless the Court has ordered otherwise, the initial production of the Warrant and entry to premises must take place between 9.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. Monday to Friday and, once officers [and other persons] have entered premises under the authority of the Warrant, they may outside those times and whilst the Warrant remains in force, remain on the premises or re-enter the premises to continue executing the Warrant.

If your undertaking is suspected of having committed a breach of the law in the country or territory of the overseas regulator named in paragraph 1 of the Warrant, the CMA expects to take the same approach to self-incrimination. Legally privileged communications\n\nThe powers under section 75 of the 2024 Act to search, take copies etc. (set out in paragraph 4(b) onwards in the Warrant) do not apply in respect of any 'privileged communication'. This is defined in section 81 of the 2024 Act to mean a communication\n\n1. between a professional legal adviser and his client, or\n\n2. made in connection with, or in contemplation of, legal proceedings and for the purposes of those proceedings,\n\nwhich would be protected from disclosure in proceedings in the High Court on grounds of legal professional privilege.\n\nFor the purposes of section 81 of the 2024 Act, a 'professional legal adviser' includes both an external and an in-house qualified legal adviser.\n\nIf you consider that a document or information is privileged, you should provide the named officer or other officer [or other person] with material of such a nature as to demonstrate to his satisfaction that the document or information, or parts of it, for which privilege is claimed, fulfil the conditions for it being privileged.",

It is not a detailed note of the powers under the 1998 Act which are subject to interpretation by the courts. Subject matter and powers\n\nOfficers of the Competition and Markets Authority ('the CMA') [[if the Judge so orders pursuant to section 28(3 A) of the 1998 Act, insert the following here and elsewhere as indicated] and other persons] have been authorised under Warrant to enter and search the premises identified in the Warrant in connection with an [delete as appropriate: [an investigation under the 1998 Act][a request for assistance from an overseas regulator under Chapter 2 of Part 5 of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (\"the 2024 Act\") (provision of investigative assistance to overseas regulators)]]. The subject matter of this investigation is set out in paragraph 2 of the Warrant. The officers [and other persons] will not elaborate on this.\n\nParagraph 4 of the Warrant sets out the powers of the named officer 2 aand other officers [and other persons] under section 28 of the 1998 Act for the purposes of the present investigation. On entering the premises, the named officer will, as a matter of practice, produce evidence of the identity of the other officers in addition to his identity when producing the Warrant.\n\nUnless the Court has ordered otherwise, the initial production of the Warrant and entry to premises must take place between 9.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. Monday to Friday and, once officers [and other persons] have entered premises under the authority of the Warrant, they may outside those times and whilst the Warrant remains in force, remain on the premises or re-enter the premises to continue executing the Warrant. Access to legal advice\n\nYou are advised to seek legal advice. If the named officer and other officers consider it reasonable in the circumstances to do so and if they are satisfied that you are complying with, or will comply with, such conditions as they consider it appropriate to impose, the named officer and other officers will grant a request to allow a reasonable time for your legal adviser to arrive at the premises before the inspection continues.\n\nIf you decide to seek legal advice you should do so promptly and this must not unduly delay or impede the inspection. Any delay must be kept to a strict minimum.\n\nIf you have an in-house legal adviser on the premises, or if you have received prior notice of the inspection, the named officer and other officers [and other persons] will not wait for your external legal adviser to arrive. Self-incrimination\n\nThe named officer and other officers [and other persons] have powers, among other matters, to search and take copies of, or extracts from, documents covered by the Warrant, to require you to produce information which is stored in any electronic form and to require you to provide an explanation of any such documents (which the 1998 Act defines as including information recorded in any form). However, if your undertaking is suspected of having committed an infringement of the 1998 Act, they cannot require you to provide answers or statements that might involve an admission on your part of the existence of that infringement. If your undertaking is suspected of having committed a breach of the law in the country or territory of the overseas regulator named in paragraph 1 of the Warrant, the CMA expects to take the same approach to self-incrimination.\n\nYou should note also that, any statement made by a person in response to a requirement imposed by the named officer or other officers [or other persons] in exercise of their powers under paragraph 4 of the Warrant, may not be used in evidence against him on a prosecution for an offence under section 188 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the cartel offence) unless, in the proceedings -\n\n• in giving evidence, he makes a statement inconsistent with it, and\n• evidence relating to it is adduced, or a question relating to it is asked, by him or on his behalf. Legally privileged communications\n\nThe powers under section 28 of the 1998 Act to search, take copies etc. (set out in paragraph 4(b) onwards in the Warrant) do not apply in respect of any 'privileged communication'. This is defined in section 30 of the 1998 Act to mean a communication\n\n• between a professional legal adviser and his client, or\n• made in connection with, or in contemplation of, legal proceedings and for the purposes of those proceedings,\n\nwhich would be protected from disclosure in proceedings in the High Court on grounds of legal professional privilege.\n\nFor the purposes of section 30 of the 1998 Act, a 'professional legal adviser' includes both an external and an in-house qualified legal adviser.\n\nIf you consider that a document or information is privileged, you should provide the named officer or other officer [or other person] with material of such a nature as to demonstrate to his satisfaction that the document or information, or parts of it, for which privilege is claimed, fulfil the conditions for it being privileged.\n\nIf you fail to do so, you should gather together the items for which privilege is claimed. These items will not be examined or copied unless you reach an agreement with the named officer that they may be examined or copied. If no agreement is reached on the day of the inspection, the named officer will request that you make a copy of the items and place this in a sealed envelope or package in his presence. The named officer will then discuss with you appropriate arrangements for the safe-keeping of these items pending resolution of the issue of privilege. For example, such arrangements may include a request that your legal adviser should give (or if no legal adviser is present, that you give), a written undertaking that the envelope or package will be retained safely and that its contents will not be concealed, removed, tampered with or destroyed until the issue of privilege is resolved. Listing of items\n\nUnless it is impracticable in all the circumstances, no item may be removed from the premises by the named officer or other officers [or other persons] until they have prepared a list of all the items to be removed, a copy of the list has been supplied to you, and you have been given a reasonable opportunity to check that the list relates to all the items concerned, and only to those items. This does not entitle you or your legal adviser to insist that the list or its contents should take any particular form. Confidentiality\n\nYou should note that, subject to the safeguards in relation to self-incrimination and legal privilege, you arenotentitled to withhold a document or information by claiming that it is confidential.\n\nWhere it is possible to do so, it is suggested that after the inspection on the premises you should identify any part or parts of any information or document copied or taken that you consider to be confidential and provide a written explanation as to why it should be treated as such. For these purposes information is confidential if it is:\n\n• commercial information the disclosure of which would, or might, significantly harm the legitimate business interests of the undertaking to which it relates; or\n• information relating to the private affairs of an individual the disclosure of which would, or might, significantly harm his interests 2.\n\nA document will be treated as confidential to the extent that it contains confidential information.\n\nIt is for the CMA to determine whether or not the information is to be disclosed in accordance with Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002. Application to vary or discharge the Warrant\n\nYou are entitled to apply to the Court to vary or discharge the Warrant. If you intend to make such an application, you must first inform the named officer. An application to stop the Warrant from being executed must be made immediately upon it being served.\n\nThe application must be made to the judge who issued the Warrant, or if he is not available, to another High Court judge.\n\nIf you are making an immediate application to stop the Warrant from being executed, the named officer will delay starting or continuing a search of the premises for a reasonable period (not exceeding two hours) while you make your application, provided that you\n\n• permit the named officer and other officers [and other persons] to enter and remain on the premises;\n• keep the named officer informed of the steps you are taking in relation to the application; and\n• comply with any other conditions that the named officer imposes.\n\nExamples of conditions that the named officer may impose pursuant to (3) above include: that you do not disturb or move any document or information that is the subject of the Warrant; and/or you do not tell anyone other than your legal adviser about the Warrant or the investigation.

Confidentiality\n\nYou should note that, subject to the safeguards in relation to self-incrimination and legal privilege, you are not entitled to withhold a document or information claiming that it is confidential.\n\nWhere it is possible to do so, it is suggested that after the entry to the premise you should identify any part or parts of any information or document copied or taken that you consider to be confidential and provide a written explanation as to why it should be treated as such. For these purposes information is confidential if it is:\n\n1. commercial information the disclosure of which the CMA thinks might significantly harm the legitimate business interests of the undertaking to which it relates;\n\n2. information relating to the private affairs of an individual the disclosure of which the CMA thinks might significantly harm the individual's interests; or\n\n3. information the disclosure of which the CMA thinks is contrary to the public interest.\n\nA document will be treated as confidential to the extent that it contains confidential information.\n\nIt is for the CMA to determine whether or not the information is to be disclosed in accordance with Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002. Application to vary or discharge the warrant\n\nYou are entitled to apply to the Court to vary or discharge the Warrant. If you intend to make such an application, you must first inform the named officer. An application to stop the Warrant from being executed must be made immediately upon it being served.\n\nThe application must be made to the judge who issued the Warrant, or if that judge is not available, to another High Court judge.\n\nIf you are making an immediate application to stop the Warrant being executed, the named officer will delay starting or continuing a search of the premises for a reasonable period (not exceeding two hours) while you make your application, provided that you\n\n1. permit the named officer and other officers [and other persons] to enter and remain on the premises;\n\n2. keep the named officer informed of the steps you are taking in relation to the application; and\n\n3. comply with any other conditions that the named officer imposes.\n\nExamples of conditions that the named officer may impose pursuant to (3) above include: that you do not disturb or move any document or information that is the subject of the Warrant; and/or you do not tell anyone other than your legal adviser about the Warrant or the investigation. Application under section 59 Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001\n\nYour attention is drawn to section 59 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which makes provision about applications relating to property seized in the exercise of the powers conferred by (among other provisions) paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 to the Regulations.\n\nAn application under section 59-\n\n1. must be made by application notice in accordance with Part 23 of the Civil Procedure Rules; and\n\n2. should be made to a judge of the Chancery Division at the Royal Courts of Justice (if available).
