and\n\n(g) 'taking control of goods' means using the procedure to take control of goods contained in Schedule 12 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 20071.\n\n(Rules 6.13 and 6.25 contain provisions about the service of documents on children and protected parties.)\n\n(Rule 46.4 deals with costs where money is payable by or to a child or protected party.)\n\n---\n\nRequirement for a litigation friend in proceedings by or against children and protected parties\n\n21.2\n\n(1) A protected party must have a litigation friend to conduct proceedings on their behalf.\n\n(2) Unless the court makes an order under paragraph (3), a litigation friend must conduct proceedings on a child's behalf.\n\n(3) The court may make an order permitting a child to conduct proceedings without a litigation friend.\n\n(4) An application for an order under paragraph (3) -\n\n(a) may be made by the child;\n\n(b) if the child already has a litigation friend, must be made on notice to the litigation friend; and\n\n(c) if the child has no litigation friend, may be made without notice.\n\n(5) Where -\n\n(a) the court has made an order under paragraph (3); and\n\n(b) it later appears to the court desirable for a litigation friend to conduct the proceedings on the child's behalf, the court may appoint a person to be the child's litigation friend.\n\n(6) Where one of the parties is a child or protected party, that party shall be referred to in the title to the proceedings as \"[name] (a [child] [protected party]) by [name] as litigation friend\".\n\n(7) Where one of the parties is a child conducting the proceedings on their own behalf, the child shall be referred to in the title as \"[name] (a child)\".\n\n---\n\nStage of proceedings at which a litigation friend becomes necessary\n\n21.3\n\n(1) This rule does not apply where the court has made an order under rule 21.2(3).\n\n(2) A person may not, without the court's permission -\n\n(a) make an application against a child or protected party before proceedings have started;

and\n\n(b) the sole purpose of proceedings is to obtain the approval of the court to a settlement or compromise or a payment (including any voluntary interim payment) which relates to the claim,\n\nthe claim must -\n\n(i) be made using the procedure set out in Part 8 (alternative procedure for claims); and\n\n(ii) include a request to the court for approval of the settlement or compromise or payment (including any voluntary interim payment).\n\n(3) The documents supporting any application or request for approval must include-\n\n(a) a draft consent order setting out the proposed settlement terms;\n\n(b) details of whether or to what extent liability is admitted;\n\n(c) the age and occupation (if any) of the child or protected party;\n\n(d) confirmation that the litigation friend approves the settlement;\n\n(e) a copy of any relevant medical, financial or other expert evidence or advice;\n\n(f) in a personal injury claim arising from an accident, details of the accident and of claimed loss and damage;\n\n(g) any documents relevant to considerations of liability;

or\n\n(b) money paid into court is accepted by or on behalf of a child or protected party,\n\nthe money will be dealt with in accordance with directions given by the court under this rule and not otherwise.\n\n(2) Directions given under this rule may provide that the money shall be wholly or partly paid into court and invested or otherwise dealt with.\n\n(3) Where money is recovered by or on behalf of a protected party or money paid into court is accepted by or on behalf of a protected party, before giving directions under this rule, the court will first consider whether the protected party is a protected beneficiary.\n\n(4) Where a child lacks capacity to manage and control any money recovered by or on behalf of the child, and is likely to remain so on reaching full age, the fund will be administered as a protected beneficiary's fund.\n\n(5) Where a child or protected beneficiary is in receipt of publicly funded legal services the fund shall be subject to a first charge under section 25 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012(1) (statutory charge) and an order for the investment of money on the child's or protected beneficiary's behalf must contain a direction to that effect.\n\n(6) The representative or litigation friend of the child or protected beneficiary must apply to the court for directions for management of the fund or payment into court (using Form CFO 320 or CFO 320 PB to be completed by the judge), stating the nature and terms of any proposed investment vehicle, with appropriate supporting evidence.\n\n(7) The judge hearing the application may adjourn it and give directions for further information to be provided and, unless the judge directs otherwise, the money recovered will be paid into the court special account pending determination of the application for investment.\n\n(8) Where money is recovered for the benefit of a child who is not a protected beneficiary-\n\n(a) if the court considers it appropriate, it may order that the money be paid directly to the litigation friend to be placed in a bank, building society or similar account for the child's use;\n\n(b) if the money remains invested in court, it must be paid out to the child when the child reaches the age of 18;\n\n(c) any investments held in court other than money must either be sold and the proceeds paid to the child, or transferred to the child, when the child reaches the age of 18.\n\n(9) Where money is recovered for the benefit of a protected beneficiary-\n\n(a) if the amount is £100,000 or more, subject to (b) below, the court shall direct the litigation friend to apply to the Court of Protection for the appointment of a deputy, after which the fund shall be dealt with as directed by the Court of Protection;\n\n(b) the procedure in sub-paragraph (a) will not apply where a person with authority to administer the protected beneficiary's financial affairs has been appointed as attorney under a registered enduring power of attorney, or as donee of a registered lasting power of attorney, or as the deputy appointed by the Court of Protection;\n\n(c) any payment out of money must be in accordance with any decision or order of the Court of Protection;\n\n(d) if an application to the Court of Protection is required, that application must be made;\n\n(e) if the Court of Protection so decides, on its own initiative or at the request of the judge hearing the application for investment, an amount exceeding £100,000 may be retained in court and invested in the same way as the fund of a child.\n\n(10) A request for payment of money from a fund held for the benefit of a child or protected party, or to vary an investment strategy, may be made in writing with appropriate supporting evidence (but without making a formal application) to a Master or District Judge and may be determined without a hearing unless the court directs otherwise.\n\n---\n\nCosts and expenses incurred by a litigation friend\n\n21.12\n\n(1) In proceedings to which rule 21.11 applies, a litigation friend who incurs costs or expenses on behalf of a child or protected party in any proceedings is entitled on application to recover the amount paid or payable out of any money recovered or paid into court to the extent that it -\n\n(a) has been reasonably incurred; and\n\n(b) is reasonable in amount.\n\n(2) Costs recoverable in respect of a child under this rule are limited to-\n\n(a) costs which have been assessed by way of detailed assessment under rule 46.4(2);\n\n(b) costs incurred by way of success fee under a conditional fee agreement or sum payable under a damages based agreement in a claim for damages for personal injury where the damages agreed or ordered to be paid do not exceed £25,000, where such costs have been summarily assessed under rule 46.4(5), or\n\n(c) costs incurred where a detailed assessment of costs has been dispensed with under rule 46.4(3) in the circumstances set out in Practice Direction 46.\n\n(3) Expenses may include all or part of -\n\n(a) a premium in respect of a costs insurance policy (as defined by section 58 C(5) of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990); or\n\n(b) interest on a loan taken out to pay a premium in respect of a costs insurance policy or other recoverable disbursement.\n\n(4) No application may be made under this rule for costs or expenses that -\n\n(a) are of a type that may be recoverable on an assessment of costs payable by or out of money belonging to a child or protected party; but\n\n(b) are disallowed in whole or in part on such an assessment.\n\n(Costs and expenses which are also \"costs\" as defined in rule 44.1(1) are subject to rule 46.4(2) and (3).)\n\n(5) In deciding whether the costs or expenses were reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount, the court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the factors set out in rule 44.4(3) and 46.9.\n\n(6) When the court is considering the factors to be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of the costs or expenses, it will have regard to the facts and circumstances as they reasonably appeared to the litigation friend or to the child's or protected party's legal representative or deputy when the cost or expense was incurred.\n\n(7) Subject to paragraph (7), where the claim is settled or compromised, or judgment is given, on terms that an amount not exceeding £5,000 is paid to the child or protected party, the total amount the litigation friend may recover under paragraph (1) must not exceed 25% of the sum so agreed or awarded, unless the court directs otherwise. Such total amount must not exceed 50% of the sum so agreed or awarded.\n\n(8) The amount which the litigation friend may recover under paragraph (1) in respect of costs must not (in proceedings at first instance) exceed 25% of the amount of the sum agreed or awarded in respect of-\n\n(a) general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity; and\n\n(b) damages for past financial loss\n\n(9) Except in a case to which Section IV, Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of Part 45 applies, and where a claim under rule 45.9 or 45.10 has not been made, no application may be made under this rule for a payment out of the money recovered by the child or protected party until the costs payable to the child or protected party have been assessed or agreed.\n\n(10) A litigation friend must support a claim for payment from a fund of costs or expenses by filing a witness statement setting out, so far as applicable-\n\n(a) the nature and amount of the costs or expenses and the reason they were incurred;\n\n(b) a copy of any conditional fee or damages based agreement;\n\n(c) a copy of any risk assessment by reference to which any success fee was determined;\n\n(d) the reasons why the particular funding model was selected;\n\n(e) the advice given to the litigation friend on funding arrangements;\n\n(f) a copy bill or informal breakdown of the solicitor and own client base costs incurred;\n\n(g) details of any costs agreed, recovered or fixed costs recoverable by the child; and\n\n(h) an explanation of the amount agreed or awarded for-\n\n(i) general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity; and\n\n(ii) damages for past financial loss, net of any sums recoverable by the Compensation Recovery Unit or the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\n---\n\nAppointment of a guardian of a child's estate\n\n21.13\n\n(1) The court may appoint the Official Solicitor to be a guardian of a child's estate where -\n\n(a) money is paid into court on behalf of the child in accordance with directions given under rule 21.11 (control of money received by a child or protected party);\n\n(b) the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority notifies the court that it has made or intends to make an award to the child;\n\n(c) a court or tribunal outside England and Wales notifies the court that it has ordered or intends to order that money be paid to the child;\n\n(d) the child is absolutely entitled to the proceeds of a pension fund; or\n\n(e) in any other case, such an appointment seems desirable to the court.\n\n(2) The court may not appoint the Official Solicitor under this rule unless -\n\n(a) the persons with parental responsibility (within the meaning of section 3 of the Children Act 19892)agree; or\n\n(b) the court considers that their agreement can be dispensed with.\n\n(3) The Official Solicitor's appointment may continue only until the child reaches 18.\n\n(Paragraph 8 of Practice Direction 40 A deals with approval of the accounts of a guardian of assets of a child.)\n\n---\n\nFootnotes\n\n• 2007 c.15.
