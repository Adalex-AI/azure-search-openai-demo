but\n\n(b) he must state in his disclosure statement that inspection of those documents will not be permitted on the grounds that to do so would be disproportionate.\n\n(Rule 31.6 provides for standard disclosure)\n\n(Rule 31.10 makes provision for a disclosure statement)\n\n(Rule 31.12 provides for a party to apply for an order for specific inspection of documents)\n\n---\n\nMeaning of document\n\n31.4 In this Part -\n\n'document' means anything in which information of any description is recorded; and\n\n'copy', in relation to a document, means anything onto which information recorded in the document has been copied, by whatever means and whether directly or indirectly.\n\n---\n\nDisclosure\n\n31.5\n\n(1) Omitted\n\n(2) Unless the court otherwise orders, paragraphs (3) to (8) apply to all intermediate and multi-track claims, other than those which include a claim for personal injuries.\n\n(3) Not less than 14 days before the first case management conference, if any, each party must file and serve a report verified by a statement of truth, which -\n\n(a) describes briefly what documents exist or may exist that are or may be relevant to the matters in issue in the case;\n\n(b) describes where and with whom those documents are or may be located;\n\n(c) in the case of electronic documents, describes how those documents are stored;\n\n(d) estimates the broad range of costs that could be involved in giving standard disclosure in the case, including the costs of searching for and disclosing any electronically stored documents; and\n\n(e) states which of the directions under paragraphs (7) or (8) are to be sought.\n\n(4) In cases where the Electronic Documents Questionnaire has been exchanged, the Questionnaire should be filed with the report required by paragraph (3).\n\n(5) Not less than seven days before the first case management conference, and on any other occasion as the court may direct, the parties must, at a meeting or by telephone, discuss and seek to agree a proposal in relation to disclosure that meets the overriding objective.\n\n(6) If -\n\n(a) the parties agree proposals for the scope of disclosure; and\n\n(b) the court considers that the proposals are appropriate in all the circumstances,\n\nthe court may approve them without a hearing and give directions in the terms proposed.\n\n(7) At the first or any subsequent case management conference, the court will decide, having regard to the overriding objective and the need to limit disclosure to that which is necessary to deal with the case justly, which of the following orders to make in relation to disclosure -\n\n(a) an order dispensing with disclosure;\n\n(b) an order that a party disclose the documents on which it relies, and at the same time request any specific disclosure it requires from any other party;\n\n(c) an order that directs, where practicable, the disclosure to be given by each party on an issue by issue basis;\n\n(d) an order that each party disclose any documents which it is reasonable to suppose may contain information which enables that party to advance its own case or to damage that of any other party, or which leads to an enquiry which has either of those consequences;\n\n(e) an order that a party give standard disclosure;\n\n(f) any other order in relation to disclosure that the court considers appropriate.\n\n(8) The court may at any point give directions as to how disclosure is to be given, and in particular -\n\n(a) what searches are to be undertaken, of where, for what, in respect of which time periods and by whom and the extent of any search for electronically stored documents;\n\n(b) whether lists of documents are required;\n\n(c) how and when the disclosure statement is to be given;\n\n(d) in what format documents are to be disclosed (and whether any identification is required);\n\n(e) what is required in relation to documents that once existed but no longer exist; and\n\n(f) whether disclosure shall take place in stages.\n\n(9) To the extent that the documents to be disclosed are electronic, the provisions of Practice Direction 31 B - Disclosure of Electronic Documents will apply in addition to paragraphs (3) to (8).\n\n---\n\nStandard disclosure - what documents are to be disclosed\n\n31.6 Standard disclosure requires a party to disclose only-\n\n(a) the documents on which he relies; and\n\n(b) the documents which -\n\n(i) adversely affect his own case;\n\n(ii) adversely affect another party's case; or\n\n(iii) support another party's case; and\n\n(c) the documents which he is required to disclose by a relevant practice direction.\n\n---\n\nDuty of search\n\n31.7\n\n(1) When giving standard disclosure, a party is required to make a reasonable search for documents falling within rule 31.6(b) or (c).\n\n(2) The factors relevant in deciding the reasonableness of a search include the following -\n\n(a) the number of documents involved;\n\n(b) the nature and complexity of the proceedings;\n\n(c) the ease and expense of retrieval of any particular document; and\n\n(d) the significance of any document which is likely to be located during the search.\n\n(3) Where a party has not searched for a category or class of document on the grounds that to do so would be unreasonable, he must state this in his disclosure statement and identify the category or class of document.\n\n(Rule 31.10 makes provision for a disclosure statement)\n\n---\n\nDuty of disclosure limited to documents which are or have been in a party's control\n\n31.8\n\n(1) A party's duty to disclose documents is limited to documents which are or have been in his control.\n\n(2) For this purpose a party has or has had a document in his control if -\n\n(a) it is or was in his physical possession;\n\n(b) he has or has had a right to possession of it;

and\n\n(b) explain why he is considered an appropriate person to make the statement.\n\n(8) The parties may agree in writing -\n\n(a) to disclose documents without making a list; and\n\n(b) to disclose documents without the disclosing party making a disclosure statement.\n\n(9) A disclosure statement may be made by a person who is not a party where this is permitted by a relevant practice direction.\n\n---\n\nDuty of disclosure continues during proceedings\n\n31.11\n\n(1) Any duty of disclosure continues until the proceedings are concluded.\n\n(2) If documents to which that duty extends come to a party's notice at any time during the proceedings, he must immediately notify every other party.\n\n---\n\nSpecific disclosure or inspection\n\n31.12\n\n(1) The court may make an order for specific disclosure or specific inspection.\n\n(2) An order for specific disclosure is an order that a party must do one or more of the following things -\n\n(a) disclose documents or classes of documents specified in the order;\n\n(b) carry out a search to the extent stated in the order;\n\n(c) disclose any documents located as a result of that search.\n\n(3) An order for specific inspection is an order that a party permit inspection of a document referred to in rule 31.3(2).\n\n(Rule 31.3(2) allows a party to state in his disclosure statement that he will not permit inspection of a document on the grounds that it would be disproportionate to do so)\n\n---\n\nDisclosure in stages\n\n31.13 The parties may agree in writing, or the court may direct, that disclosure or inspection or both shall take place in stages.\n\n---\n\nDocuments referred to in statements of case etc.\n\n31.14\n\n(1) A party may inspect a document mentioned in -\n\n(a) a statement of case;\n\n(b) a witness statement;\n\n(c) a witness summary;
