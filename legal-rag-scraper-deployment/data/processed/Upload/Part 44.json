and\n\n(c) when they are to be paid.\n\n(2) If the court decides to make an order about costs -\n\n(a) the general rule is that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party;

and\n\n(g) interest on costs from or until a certain date, including a date before judgment.\n\n(7) Before the court considers making an order under paragraph (6)(f), it will consider whether it is practicable to make an order under paragraph (6)(a) or (c) instead.\n\n(8) Where the court orders a party to pay costs subject to detailed assessment, it will order that party to pay a reasonable sum on account of costs, unless there is good reason not to do so.\n\n(9) In respect of a SLAPP claim, a court may not exercise its discretion so as to order a defendant to pay a claimant's costs except where, in the court's view, misconduct of the defendant in relation to the claim justifies such an order.\n\n(10) For the purposes of paragraph (9), a SLAPP claim is strategic litigation against public participation being a SLAPP claim within the meaning of section 195 of the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023.\n\n(Rules 20.2 and 20.3 provide that counterclaims and other additional claims are treated as claims and that references to a claimant or a defendant include a party bringing or defending an additional claim.)\n\n---\n\nBasis of assessment\n\n44.3\n\n(1) Where the court is to assess the amount of costs (whether by summary or detailed assessment) it will assess those costs -\n\n(a) on the standard basis; or\n\n(b) on the indemnity basis,\n\nbut the court will not in either case allow costs which have been unreasonably incurred or are unreasonable in amount.\n\n(Rule 44.5 sets out how the court decides the amount of costs payable under a contract.)\n\n(2) Where the amount of costs is to be assessed on the standard basis, the court will -\n\n(a) only allow costs which are proportionate to the matters in issue. Costs which are disproportionate in amount may be disallowed or reduced even if they were reasonably or necessarily incurred; and\n\n(b) resolve any doubt which it may have as to whether costs were reasonably and proportionately incurred or were reasonable and proportionate in amount in favour of the paying party.\n\n(Factors which the court may take into account are set out in rule 44.4.)\n\n(3) Where the amount of costs is to be assessed on the indemnity basis, the court will resolve any doubt which it may have as to whether costs were reasonably incurred or were reasonable in amount in favour of the receiving party.\n\n(4) Where -\n\n(a) the court makes an order about costs without indicating the basis on which the costs are to be assessed; or\n\n(b) the court makes an order for costs to be assessed on a basis other than the standard basis or the indemnity basis,\n\nthe costs will be assessed on the standard basis.\n\n(5) Costs incurred are proportionate if they bear a reasonable relationship to -\n\n(a) the sums in issue in the proceedings;\n\n(b) the value of any non-monetary relief in issue in the proceedings;\n\n(c) the complexity of the litigation;\n\n(d) any additional work generated by the conduct of the paying party,\n\n(e) any wider factors involved in the proceedings, such as reputation or public importance; and\n\n(f) any additional work undertaken or expense incurred due to the vulnerability of a party or any witness.\n\n(6) Where the amount of a solicitor's remuneration in respect of non-contentious business is regulated by any general orders made under the Solicitors Act 19744,the amount of the costs to be allowed in respect of any such business which falls to be assessed by the court will be decided in accordance with those general orders rather than this rule and rule 44.4.\n\n(7) Paragraphs (2)(a) and (5) do not apply in relation to -\n\n(a) cases commenced before 1 st April 2013; or\n\n(b) costs incurred in respect of work done before 1 st April 2013,\n\nand in relation to such cases or costs, rule 44.4.(2)(a) as it was in force immediately before 1 st April 2013 will apply instead.\n\n---\n\nFactors to be taken into account in deciding the amount of costs\n\n44.4\n\n(1) The court will have regard to all the circumstances in deciding whether costs were -\n\n(a) if it is assessing costs on the standard basis -\n\n(i) proportionately and reasonably incurred; or\n\n(ii) proportionate and reasonable in amount, or\n\n(b) if it is assessing costs on the indemnity basis -\n\n(i) unreasonably incurred; or\n\n(ii) unreasonable in amount.\n\n(2) In particular, the court will give effect to any orders which have already been made.\n\n(3) The court will also have regard to -\n\n(a) the conduct of all the parties, including in particular -\n\n(i) conduct before, as well as during, the proceedings; and\n\n(ii) the efforts made, if any, before and during the proceedings in order to try to resolve the dispute;\n\n(b) the amount or value of any money or property involved;\n\n(c) the importance of the matter to all the parties;\n\n(d) the particular complexity of the matter or the difficulty or novelty of the questions raised;\n\n(e) the skill, effort, specialised knowledge and responsibility involved;\n\n(f) the time spent on the case;\n\n(g) the place where and the circumstances in which work or any part of it was done; and\n\n(h) the receiving party's last approved or agreed budget.\n\n(Rule 35.4(4) gives the court power to limit the amount that a party may recover with regard to the fees and expenses of an expert.)\n\n---\n\nAmount of costs where costs are payable under a contract\n\n44.5\n\n(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), where the court assesses (whether by summary or detailed assessment) costs which are payable by the paying party to the receiving party under the terms of a contract, the costs payable under those terms are, unless the contract expressly provides otherwise, to be presumed to be costs which -\n\n(a) have been reasonably incurred; and\n\n(b) are reasonable in amount,\n\nand the court will assess them accordingly.\n\n(2) The presumptions in paragraph (1) are rebuttable. Practice Direction 44 - General rules about costs sets out circumstances where the court may order otherwise.\n\n(3) Paragraph (1) does not apply where the contract is between a solicitor and client.\n\n---\n\nProcedure for assessing costs\n\n44.6\n\n(1) Where the court orders a party to pay costs to another party (other than fixed costs) it may either -\n\n(a) make a summary assessment of the costs; or\n\n(b) order detailed assessment of the costs by a costs officer,\n\nunless any rule, practice direction or other enactment provides otherwise.\n\n(Practice Direction 44 - General rules about costs sets out the factors which will affect the court's decision under paragraph (1).)\n\n(2) A party may recover the fixed costs specified in Part 45 in accordance with that Part.\n\n---\n\nTime for complying with an order for costs\n\n44.7\n\n(1) A party must comply with an order for the payment of costs within 14 days of -\n\n(a) the date of the judgment or order if it states the amount of those costs;\n\n(b) if the amount of those costs (or part of them) is decided later in accordance with Part 47, the date of the certificate which states the amount; or\n\n(c) in either case, such other date as the court may specify.\n\n(Part 47 sets out the procedure for detailed assessment of costs.)\n\n---\n\nLegal representative's duty to notify the party\n\n44.8 Where -\n\n(a) the court makes a costs order against a legally represented party; and\n\n(b) the party is not present when the order is made,\n\nthe party's legal representative must notify that party in writing of the costs order no later than 7 days after the legal representative receives notice of the order.\n\n(Paragraph 10.1 of Practice Direction 44 defines 'party' for the purposes of this rule.)\n\n---\n\nCases where costs orders deemed to have been made\n\n44.9\n\n(1) Subject to paragraph (2), where a right to costs arises under -\n\n(a) rule 3.7 or 3.7 A 1 (defendant's right to costs where claim is struck out for non-payment of fees);\n\n(a 1) rule 3.7 B (sanctions for dishonouring cheque);\n\n(b) rule 36.13(1) or (2) (claimant's entitlement to costs where a Part 36 offer is accepted); or\n\n(c) rule 38.6 (defendant's right to costs where claimant discontinues),\n\na costs order will be deemed to have been made on the standard basis, save that where the claim is one to which the provisions of Part 27 or Part 45 would otherwise apply, the costs shall be determined in accordance with those Parts.\n\n(2) Paragraph 1(b) does not apply where a Part 36 offer is accepted before the commencement of proceedings.\n\n(3) Where such an order is deemed to be made in favour of a party with pro bono representation, that party may apply for an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act.\n\n(4) Interest payable under section 17 of the Judgments Act 18385 or section 74 of the County Courts Act 19846 on the costs deemed to have been ordered under paragraph (1) will begin to run from the date on which the event which gave rise to the entitlement to costs occurred.\n\n---\n\nWhere the court makes no order for costs\n\n44.10\n\n(1) Where the court makes an order which does not mention costs -\n\n(a) subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the general rule is that no party is entitled -\n\n(i) to costs; or\n\n(ii) to seek an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act,\n\nin relation to that order; but\n\n(b) this does not affect any entitlement of a party to recover costs out of a fund held by that party as trustee or personal representative, or under any lease, mortgage or other security.\n\n(2) Where the court makes -\n\n(a) an order granting permission to appeal;\n\n(b) an order granting permission to apply for judicial review; or\n\n(c) any other order or direction sought by a party on an application without notice,\n\nand its order does not mention costs, it will be deemed to include an order for applicant's costs in the case.\n\n(3) Any party affected by a deemed order for costs under paragraph (2) may apply at any time to vary the order.\n\n(4) The court hearing an appeal may, unless it dismisses the appeal, make orders about the costs of the proceedings giving rise to the appeal as well as the costs of the appeal.\n\n(5) Subject to any order made by the transferring court, where proceedings are transferred from one court to another, the court to which they are transferred may deal with all the costs, including the costs before the transfer.\n\n---\n\nCourt's powers in relation to misconduct\n\n44.11\n\n(1) The court may make an order under this rule where -\n\n(a) a party or that party's legal representative, in connection with a summary or detailed assessment, fails to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order; or\n\n(b) it appears to the court that the conduct of a party or that party's legal representative, before or during the proceedings or in the assessment proceedings, was unreasonable or improper.\n\n(2) Where paragraph (1) applies, the court may -\n\n(a) disallow all or part of the costs which are being assessed; or\n\n(b) order the party at fault or that party's legal representative to pay costs which that party or legal representative has caused any other party to incur.\n\n(3) Where -\n\n(a) the court makes an order under paragraph (2) against a legally represented party; and\n\n(b) the party is not present when the order is made,\n\nthe party's legal representative must notify that party in writing of the order no later than 7 days after the legal representative receives notice of the order.\n\n---\n\nSet Off\n\n44.12\n\n(1) Where a party entitled to costs is also liable to pay costs, the court may assess the costs which that party is liable to pay and either -\n\n(a) set off the amount assessed against the amount the party is entitled to be paid and direct that party to pay any balance; or\n\n(b) delay the issue of a certificate for the costs to which the party is entitled until the party has paid the amount which that party is liable to pay\n\nII QUALIFIED ONE-WAY COSTS SHIFTING\n\n---\n\nQualified one-way costs shifting: scope and interpretation\n\n44.13\n\n(1) This Section applies to proceedings which include a claim for damages -\n\n(a) for personal injuries;\n\n(b) under the Fatal Accidents Act 19767;or\n\n(c) which arises out of death or personal injury and survives for the benefit of an estate by virtue of section 1(1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 19348,\n\nbut does not apply to applications pursuant to section 33 of the Senior Courts Act 19819 or section 52 of the County Courts Act 198410(applications for pre-action disclosure), or where rule 44.17 applies.\n\n(2) In this Section, 'claimant' means a person bringing a claim to which this Section applies or an estate on behalf of which such a claim is brought, and includes a person making a counterclaim or an additional claim.\n\n---\n\nEffect of qualified one-way costs shifting\n\n44.14\n\n(1) Subject to rules 44.15 and 44.16, orders for costs made against a claimant may be enforced without the permission of the court but only to the extent that the aggregate amount in money terms of such orders does not exceed the aggregate amount in money terms of any orders for, or agreements to pay or settle a claim for, damages, costs and interest made in favour of the claimant.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this Section, orders for costs includes orders for costs deemed to have been made (either against the claimant or in favour of the claimant) as set out in rule 44.9.\n\n(3) Orders for costs made against a claimant may only be enforced after the proceedings have been concluded and the costs have been assessed or agreed.\n\n(4) Where enforcement is permitted against any order for costs made in favour of the claimant, rule 44.12 applies.\n\n(5) An order for costs which is enforced only to the extent permitted by paragraph (1) shall not be treated as an unsatisfied or outstanding judgment for the purposes of any court record.\n\n---\n\nExceptions to qualified one-way costs shifting where permission not required\n\n44.15 Orders for costs made against the claimant may be enforced to the full extent of such orders without the permission of the court where the proceedings have been struck out on the grounds that -\n\n(a) the claimant has disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the proceedings;\n\n(b) the proceedings are an abuse of the court's process; or\n\n(c) the conduct of -\n\n(i) the claimant; or\n\n(ii) a person acting on the claimant's behalf and with the claimant's knowledge of such conduct,\n\nis likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings.\n\n---\n\nExceptions to qualified one-way costs shifting where permission required\n\n44.16\n\n(1) Orders for costs made against the claimant may be enforced to the full extent of such orders with the permission of the court where the claim is found on the balance of probabilities to be fundamentally dishonest.\n\n(2) Orders for costs made against the claimant may be enforced up to the full extent of such orders with the permission of the court, and to the extent that it considers just, where -\n\n(a) the proceedings include a claim which is made for the financial benefit of a person other than the claimant or a dependant within the meaning of section 1(3) of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (other than a claim in respect of the gratuitous provision of care, earnings paid by an employer or medical expenses); or\n\n(b) a claim is made for the benefit of the claimant other than a claim to which this Section applies.\n\n(3) Where paragraph (2)(a) applies, the court may, subject to rule 46.2, make an order for costs against a person, other than the claimant, for whose financial benefit the whole or part of the claim was made.\n\n---\n\nTransitional provision\n\n44.17 This Section does not apply to proceedings where the claimant has entered into a pre-commencement funding arrangement (as defined in rule 48.2).\n\nIII DAMAGES-BASED AGREEMENTS\n\n---\n\nAward of costs where there is a damages-based agreement\n\n44.18\n\n(1) The fact that a party has entered into a damages-based agreement will not affect the making of any order for costs which otherwise would be made in favour of that party.\n\n(2) Where costs are to be assessed in favour of a party who has entered into a damages-based agreement -\n\n(a) the party's recoverable costs will be assessed in accordance with rule 44.3;
