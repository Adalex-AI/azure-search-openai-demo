VAT\n\n45.2. Where appropriate, VAT may be recovered in addition to the amount of fixed in costs rules 45.8 and 45.15 A and in Section IV, Section VI, Section VII, Section VIII or Section X of this Part and any reference to fixed costs in those Sections is a reference to those costs net of any such VAT. Additional costs for work in specified areas ('London weighting')\n\n45.3.-(1) Where fixed costs are payable under Section IV, Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part and the receiving party-\n\n(a)lives, works or carries on business in any area set out in Section II of Practice Direction 45; and\n\n(b)instructs a legal representative with conduct of the litigation who practises in any of those areas,\n\nthe fixed costs shall include, in addition to the costs allowable in the relevant Section, an amount equal to 12.5% of those fixed costs ('London weighting').\n\n(2) In this rule 'fixed costs' excludes any disbursements.
