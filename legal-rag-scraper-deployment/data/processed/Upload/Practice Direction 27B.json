and\n\n(b) should normally order the defendant to pay the court fee incurred when the claim was started or continued for determination of liability.\n\n(3) The court may give other directions and may reallocate the claim to a different track where it considers that the value of the claim is likely to exceed the limit for the small claims track.\n\nSECTION 3: Assessing the value of the claim: no liability dispute, no claim for non-protocol vehicle costs or uplift request\n\nUse of this section\n\n3.1\n\n(1) This section sets out the procedure to be followed where the claimant wishes the court to assess the value of the claim, where-\n\n(a) the parties have been unable to agree settlement under the RTA Small Claims Protocol;\n\n(b) liability is not in dispute (as to which, see paragraph 3.2 below);\n\n(c) there is no claim brought fornon-protocol vehicle costs; and\n\n(d) there is no application for anupliftin exceptional circumstances pursuant to regulation 3 of the Whiplash Injury Regulations 2021 (referred to in this paragraph as an \"upliftapplication\").\n\n(2) For the purposes of this section, \"liability is not in dispute\" means that either-\n\n(a) there has been anadmission of liability in full;\n\n(b) there has been anadmission of liability in partand the claimant has accepted that part admission;
