and\n\n(c) the approval of the court is not required by these Rules, a practice direction or any enactment before an agreed order can be made.\n\n(3) The judgments and orders referred to in paragraph (2) are -\n\n(a) a judgment or order for -\n\n(i) the payment of an amount of money (including a judgment or order for damages or the value of goods to be decided by the court); or\n\n(ii) the delivery up of goods with or without the option of paying the value of the goods or the agreed value.\n\n(b) an order for -\n\n(i) the dismissal of any proceedings, wholly or in part;\n\n(ii) the stay(GL)of proceedings on agreed terms, disposing of the proceedings, whether those terms are recorded in a schedule to the order or elsewhere;\n\n(iii) the stay of enforcement of a judgment, either unconditionally or on condition that the money due under the judgment is paid by instalments specified in the order;\n\n(iv) the setting aside under Part 13 of a default judgment which has not been satisfied;\n\n(v) the payment out of money which has been paid into court;\n\n(vi) the discharge from liability of any party;\n\n(vii) the payment, assessment or waiver of costs, or such other provision for costs as may be agreed.\n\n(4) Rule 40.3 (drawing up and filing of judgments and orders) applies to judgments and orders entered and sealed by a court officer under paragraph (2) as it applies to other judgments and orders.\n\n(5) Where paragraph (2) does not apply, any party may apply for a judgment or order in the terms agreed.\n\n(6) The court may deal with an application under paragraph (5) without a hearing.\n\n(7) Where this rule applies -\n\n(a) the order which is agreed by the parties must be drawn up in the terms agreed;\n\n(b) it must be expressed as being 'By Consent';\n\n(c) it must be signed by the legal representative acting for each of the parties to whom the order relates or, where paragraph (5) applies, by the party if he is a litigant in person.\n\n---\n\nWhen judgment or order takes effect\n\n40.7\n\n(1) A judgment or order takes effect from the day when it is given or made, or such later date as the court may specify.\n\n(2) This rule applies to all judgments and orders except those to which rule 40.10 (judgment against a State) applies.\n\n---\n\nTime from which interest begins to run\n\n40.8\n\n(1) Where interest is payable on a judgment pursuant to section 17 of the Judgments Act 18381 or section 74 of the County Courts Act 19842,the interest shall begin to run from the date that judgment is given unless -\n\n(a) a rule in another Part or a practice direction makes different provision;

or\n\n(b) other relief,\n\non the ground of matters which have occurred since the date of the judgment or order, and the court may by order grant such relief, and on such terms, as it thinks just.\n\n---\n\nWho may apply to set aside or vary a judgment or order\n\n40.9 A person who is not a party but who is directly affected by a judgment or order may apply to have the judgment or order set aside or varied.\n\n---\n\nCounty Court judgments and orders - variation of payment\n\n40.9 A\n\n(1) In this rule-(a) 'creditor' means the person entitled to the benefit of a judgment or order;\n\n(b) 'debtor' means the person liable to make the payment under the judgment or order;

or\n\n(ii) by instalments; or\n\n(b) if already payable by instalments, be paid by the same or smaller instalments,\n\nand the court officer may make an order accordingly, subject to paragraph (4).\n\n(4) If no payment has been made under the judgment or order for 6 years before the date of the application, the court officer must refer the application to the District Judge.\n\n(5) The creditor may apply to the District Judge in writing and on notice for an order that the money-\n\n(a) if payable in one sum, be paid at an earlier date than that by which it is due;
