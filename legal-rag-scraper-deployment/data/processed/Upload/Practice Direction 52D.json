APPEALS TO THE COUNTY COURT Appeals under sections 204 and 204 A of the Housing Act 1996\n\n28.1\n\n(1) An appellant should include appeals under section 204 and section 204 A of the Housing Act 1996 in one appellant's notice.\n\n(2) If it is not possible to do so (for example because an urgent application under section 204 A is required) the appeals may be included in separate appellant's notices.\n\n(3) An appeal under section 204 A may include an application for an order under section 204 A(4)(a) requiring the authority to secure that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation.\n\n(4) If, exceptionally, the court makes an order under section 204 A(4)(a) without notice, the appellant's notice must be served on the authority together with the order. Such an order will normally require the authority to secure that accommodation is available until a hearing date when the authority can make representations as to whether the order under section 204 A(4)(a) should be continued.\n\n(5) Unless the court orders otherwise -\n\n(a) the appellant shall file and serve its proposed case management directions for the appeal together with the appellant's notice;\n\n(b) the respondent shall within 14 days thereafter either agree those directions or file and serve alternative proposed directions;\n\n(c) within 14 days after service of the appellant's notice the respondent must disclose any documents relevant to the decision under appeal, in so far as not previously disclosed;\n\n(d) within 14 days after receipt of any documents disclosed under sub-paragraph (c) the appellant may make any amendments to its grounds of appeal which arise out of those documents. Appeal under Part II of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (carriers' liability)\n\n29.1\n\n(1) A person appealing to the County Court under section 35 A or section 40 B of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 ('the Act') against a decision by the Secretary of State to impose a penalty under section 32 or a charge under section 40 of the Act must, subject to sub-paragraph (2), file the appellant's notice within 28 days after receiving the penalty notice or charge notice.\n\n(2) Where the appellant has given notice of objection to the Secretary of State under section 35(4) or section 40 A(3) of the Act within the time prescribed for doing so, the appellant must file the appellant's notice within 28 days after receiving notice of the Secretary of State's decision in response to the notice of objection.\n\n(3) Sections 35 A and 40 B of the Act provide that any appeal under those sections shall be a re-hearing of the Secretary of State's decision to impose a penalty or charge, and therefore rule 52.21(1) does not apply. Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976\n\n30.1 Where one of the grounds upon which an appeal against a notice under sections 21, 23 or 35 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 is brought is that -\n\n(a) it would have been fairer to serve the notice on another person; or\n\n(b) that it would be reasonable for the whole or part of the expenses to which the appeal relates to be paid by some other person,\n\nthat person must be made a respondent to the appeal, unless the court, on application of the appellant made without notice, otherwise directs.
