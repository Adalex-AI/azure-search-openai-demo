I PART 36 OFFERS TO SETTLE\n\nGeneral Scope of this Section\n\n36.2\n\n(1) This Section-\n\n(a)applies to an offer to settle to which Section II of this Part applies, unless otherwise stated; but\n\n(b)does not apply to an offer to settle to which Section III applies.\n\n(2) Nothing in this Section prevents a party making an offer to settle in whatever way that party chooses, but if the offer is not made in accordance with rule 36.5, it will not have the consequences specified in this Section.\n\n(Rule 44.2 requires the court to consider an offer to settle that does not have the costs consequences set out in this Section in deciding what order to make about costs.)\n\n(3) A Part 36 offer may be made in respect of the whole, or part of, or any issue that arises in-\n\n(a) a claim, counterclaim or other additional claim; or\n\n(b) an appeal or cross-appeal from a decision made at a trial.\n\n(Rules 20.2 and 20.3 provide that counterclaims and other additional claims are treated as claims and that references to a claimant or a defendant include a party bringing or defending an additional claim.) Definitions\n\n36.3 In this Section-\n\n(a) the party who makes an offer is the \"offeror\";\n\n(b) the party to whom an offer is made is the \"offeree\";\n\n(c) a \"trial\" means any trial in a case whether it is a trial of all issues or a trial of liability, quantum or some other issue in the case;\n\n(d) a trial is \"in progress\" from the time when it starts until the time when judgment is given or handed down;\n\n(e) a case is \"decided\" when all issues in the case have been determined, whether at one or more trials;\n\n(f) \"trial judge\" includes the judge (if any) allocated in advance to conduct a trial; and\n\n(g) \"the relevant period\" means-\n\n(i) in the case of an offer made not less than 21 days before a trial, the period specified under rule 36.5(1)(c) or such longer period as the parties agree;\n\n(ii) otherwise, the period up to the end of such trial. Application of Part 36 to appeals\n\n36.4\n\n(1) Except where a Part 36 offer is made in appeal proceedings, it shall have the consequences set out in this Section only in relation to the costs of the proceedings in respect of which it is made, and not in relation to the costs of any appeal from a decision in those proceedings.\n\n(2) Where a Part 36 offer is made in appeal proceedings, references in this Section to a term in the first column below shall be treated, unless the context requires otherwise, as references to the corresponding term in the second column- Making offers Form and content of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.5\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer must-\n\n(a) be in writing;\n\n(b) make clear that it is made pursuant to Part 36;\n\n(c) specify a period of not less than 21 days within which the defendant will be liable for the claimant's costs in accordance with rule 36.13 or 36.23 if the offer is accepted;\n\n(d) state whether it relates to the whole of the claim or to part of it or to an issue that arises in it and if so to which part or issue; and\n\n(e) state whether it takes into account any counterclaim.\n\n(Rule 36.7 makes provision for when a Part 36 offer is made.)\n\n(2) Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply if the offer is made less than 21 days before the start of a trial.\n\n(3) In appropriate cases, a Part 36 offer must contain such further information as is required by rule 36.18 (personal injury claims for future pecuniary loss), rule 36.19 (offer to settle a claim for provisional damages), and rule 36.20 (deduction of benefits).\n\n(4) A Part 36 offer which offers to pay or offers to accept a sum of money will be treated as inclusive of all interest until-\n\n(a) the date on which the period specified under rule 36.5(1)(c) expires; or\n\n(b) if rule 36.5(2) applies, a date 21 days after the date the offer was made.\n\n(5) A Part 36 offer to accept a sum of money may make provision for accrual of interest on such sum after the date specified in paragraph (4). If such an offer does not make any such provision, it shall be treated as inclusive of all interest up to the date of acceptance if it is later accepted. Part 36 offers - defendant's offer\n\n36.6\n\n(1) Subject to rules 36.18(3) and 36.19(1), a Part 36 offer by a defendant to pay a sum of money in settlement of a claim must be an offer to pay a single sum of money.\n\n(2) A defendant's offer that includes an offer to pay all or part of the sum at a date later than 14 days following the date of acceptance will not be treated as a Part 36 offer unless the offeree accepts the offer. Time when a Part 36 offer is made\n\n36.7\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer may be made at any time, including before the commencement of proceedings.\n\n(2) A Part 36 offer is made when it is served on the offeree.\n\n(Part 6 provides detailed rules about service of documents.)\n\nClarifying, withdrawing and changing the terms of offers Clarification of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.8\n\n(1) The offeree may, within 7 days of a Part 36 offer being made, request the offeror to clarify the offer.\n\n(2) If the offeror does not give the clarification requested under paragraph (1) within 7 days of receiving the request, the offeree may, unless the trial has started, apply for an order that the offeror do so.\n\n(Part 23 contains provisions about making an application to the court.)\n\n(3) If the court makes an order under paragraph (2), it must specify the date when the Part 36 offer is to be treated as having been made. Withdrawing or changing the terms of a Part 36 offer generally\n\n36.9\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer can only be withdrawn, or its terms changed, if the offeree has not previously served notice of acceptance.\n\n(2) The offeror withdraws the offer or changes its terms by serving written notice of the withdrawal or change of terms on the offeree.\n\n(Rule 36.17(7) deals with the costs consequences following judgment of an offer which is withdrawn.)\n\n(3) Subject to rule 36.10, such notice of withdrawal or change of terms takes effect when it is served on the offeree.\n\n(Rule 36.10 makes provision about when permission is required to withdraw or change the terms of an offer before the expiry of the relevant period.)\n\n(4) Subject to paragraph (1), after expiry of the relevant period-\n\n(a) the offeror may withdraw the offer or change its terms without the permission of the court; or\n\n(b) the offer may be automatically withdrawn in accordance with its terms.\n\n(5) Where the offeror changes the terms of a Part 36 offer to make it more advantageous to the offeree-\n\n(a) such improved offer shall be treated, not as the withdrawal of the original offer; but as the making of a new Part 36 offer on the improved terms; and\n\n(b) subject to rule 36.5(2), the period specified under rule 36.5(1)(c) shall be 21 days or such longer period (if any) identified in the written notice referred to in paragraph (2). Withdrawing or changing the terms of a Part 36 offer before the expiry of the relevant period\n\n36.10\n\n(1) Subject to rule 36.9(1), this rule applies where the offeror serves notice before expiry of the relevant period of withdrawal of the offer or change of its terms to be less advantageous to the offeree.\n\n(2) Where this rule applies-\n\n(a) if the offeree has not served notice of acceptance of the original offer by the expiry of the relevant period, the offeror's notice has effect on the expiry of that period; and\n\n(b) if the offeree serves notice of acceptance of the original offer before the expiry of the relevant period, that acceptance has effect unless the offeror applies to the court for permission to withdraw the offer or to change its terms-\n\n(i) within 7 days of the offeree's notice of acceptance; or\n\n(ii) if earlier, before the first day of trial.\n\n(3) On an application under paragraph (2)(b), the court may give permission for the original offer to be withdrawn or its terms changed if satisfied that there has been a change of circumstances since the making of the original offer and that it is in the interests of justice to give permission. Accepting offers Acceptance of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.11\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer is accepted by serving written notice of acceptance on the offeror.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4) and to rule 36.12, a Part 36 offer may be accepted at any time (whether or not the offeree has subsequently made a different offer), unless it has already been withdrawn.\n\n(Rule 21.10 deals with compromise, etc. by or on behalf of a child or protected party.)\n\n(Rules 36.9 and 36.10 deal with withdrawal of Part 36 offers.)\n\n(3) The court's permission is required to accept a Part 36 offer where-\n\n(a) rule 36.15(4) applies;\n\n(b) rule 36.20(3)(b) applies, the relevant period has expired and further deductible amounts have been paid to the claimant since the date of the offer;\n\n(c) an apportionment is required under rule 41.3 A; or\n\n(d) a trial is in progress.\n\n(Rule 36.15 deals with offers by some but not all of multiple defendants.)\n\n(Rule 36.20 defines \"deductible amounts\".)\n\n(Rule 41.3 A requires an apportionment in proceedings under the Fatal Accidents Act 19761 and Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 19342.)\n\n(4) Where the court gives permission under paragraph (3), unless all the parties have agreed costs, the court must make an order dealing with costs, and may order that the costs consequences set out in rule 36.13 apply. Acceptance of a Part 36 offer in a split-trial case\n\n36.12\n\n(1) This rule applies in any case where there has been a trial but the case has not been decided within the meaning of rule 36.3.\n\n(2) Any Part 36 offer which relates only to parts of the claim or issues that have already been decided can no longer be accepted.\n\n(3) Subject to paragraph (2) and unless the parties agree, any other Part 36 offer cannot be accepted earlier than 7 clear days after judgment is given or handed down in such trial. Costs consequences of acceptance of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.13\n\n(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (4) and to rule 36.23, where a Part 36 offer is accepted within the relevant period the claimant will be entitled to the costs of the proceedings (including their recoverable pre-action costs) up to the date on which notice of acceptance was served on the offeror.\n\n(Rule 36.20 makes provision for the costs consequences of accepting a Part 36 offer in certain personal injury claims where the claim no longer proceeds under the RTA or EL/PL Protocol.)\n\n(2) Where-\n\n(a) a defendant's Part 36 offer relates to part only of the claim; and\n\n(b) at the time of serving notice of acceptance within the relevant period the claimant abandons the balance of the claim,\n\nthe claimant will only be entitled to the costs of such part of the claim unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(3) Except where the recoverable costs are fixed by these Rules, costs under paragraphs (1) and (2) are to be assessed on the standard basis if the amount of costs is not agreed.\n\n(Rule 44.3(2) explains the standard basis for the assessment of costs.)\n\n(Rule 44.9 contains provisions about when a costs order is deemed to have been made and applying for an order under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 20073.)\n\n(Part 45 provides for fixed costs in certain classes of case.)\n\n(4) Where-\n\n(a) a Part 36 offer which was made less than 21 days before the start of a trial is accepted; or\n\n(b) a Part 36 offer which relates to the whole of the claim is accepted after expiry of the relevant period; or\n\n(c) subject to paragraph (2), a Part 36 offer which does not relate to the whole of the claim is accepted at any time,\n\nthe liability for costs must be determined by the court unless the parties have agreed the costs.\n\n(5) Where paragraph (4)(b) applies but the parties cannot agree the liability for costs, the court must, unless it considers it unjust to do so, order that-\n\n(a) the claimant be awarded costs up to the date on which the relevant period expired; and\n\n(b) the offeree do pay the offeror's costs for the period from the date of expiry of the relevant period to the date of acceptance.\n\n(6) In considering whether it would be unjust to make the orders specified in paragraph (5), the court must take into account all the circumstances of the case including the matters listed in rule 36.17(5).\n\n(7) The claimant's costs include any costs incurred in dealing with the defendant's counterclaim if the Part 36 offer states that it takes it into account. Other effects of acceptance of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.14\n\n(1) If a Part 36 offer is accepted, the claim will be stayed.\n\n(2) In the case of acceptance of a Part 36 offer which relates to the whole claim, the stay will be upon the terms of the offer.\n\n(3) If a Part 36 offer which relates to part only of the claim is accepted, the claim will be stayed as to that part upon the terms of the offer.\n\n(4) If the approval of the court is required before a settlement can be binding, any stay which would otherwise arise on the acceptance of a Part 36 offer will take effect only when that approval has been given.\n\n(5) Any stay arising under this rule will not affect the power of the court-\n\n(a) to enforce the terms of a Part 36 offer; or\n\n(b) to deal with any question of costs (including interest on costs) relating to the proceedings.\n\n(6) Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, where a Part 36 offer that is or includes an offer to pay or accept a single sum of money is accepted, that sum must be paid to the claimant within 14 days of the date of-\n\n(a) acceptance; or\n\n(b) the order when the court makes an order under rule 41.2 (order for an award of provisional damages) or rule 41.8 (order for an award of periodical payments), unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(7) If such sum is not paid within 14 days of acceptance of the offer, or such other period as has been agreed, the claimant may enter judgment for the unpaid sum.\n\n(8) Where-\n\n(a) a Part 36 offer (or part of a Part 36 offer) which is not an offer to which paragraph (6) applies is accepted; and\n\n(b) a party alleges that the other party has not honoured the terms of the offer,\n\nthat party may apply to enforce the terms of the offer without the need for a new claim. Acceptance of a Part 36 offer made by one or more, but not all, defendants\n\n36.15\n\n(1) This rule applies where the claimant wishes to accept a Part 36 offer made by one or more, but not all, of a number of defendants.\n\n(2) If the defendants are sued jointly or in the alternative, the claimant may accept the offer if-\n\n(a) the claimant discontinues the claim against those defendants who have not made the offer; and\n\n(b) those defendants give written consent to the acceptance of the offer.\n\n(3) If the claimant alleges that the defendants have a several liability(GL)to the claimant, the claimant may-\n\n(a) accept the offer; and\n\n(b) continue with the claims against the other defendants if entitled to do so.\n\n(4) In all other cases the claimant must apply to the court for permission to accept the Part 36 offer. Unaccepted offers Restriction on disclosure of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.16\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer will be treated as \"without prejudice except as to costs\".\n\n(2) The fact that a Part 36 offer has been made and the terms of such offer must not be communicated to the trial judge until the case has been decided.\n\n(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply-\n\n(a) where the defence of tender before claim has been raised;\n\n(b) where the proceedings have been stayed under rule 36.14 following acceptance of a Part 36 offer;\n\n(c) where the offeror and the offeree agree in writing that it should not apply; or\n\n(d) where, although the case has not been decided-\n\n(i) any part of, or issue in, the case has been decided; and\n\n(ii) the Part 36 offer relates only to parts or issues that have been decided.\n\n(4) In a case to which paragraph (3)(d)(i) applies, the trial judge-\n\n(a) may be told whether or not there are Part 36 offers other than those referred to in paragraph (3)(d)(ii); but\n\n(b) must not be told the terms of any such other offers unless any of paragraphs (3)(a) to (c) applies. Costs consequences following judgment\n\n36.17\n\n(1) Subject to rule 36.24, this rule applies where upon judgment being entered-\n\n(a) a claimant fails to obtain a judgment more advantageous than a defendant's Part 36 offer; or\n\n(b) judgment against the defendant is at least as advantageous to the claimant as the proposals contained in a claimant's Part 36 offer.\n\n(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), in relation to any money claim or money element of a claim, \"more advantageous\" means better in money terms by any amount, however small, and \"at least as advantageous\" shall be construed accordingly.\n\n(3) Subject to paragraphs (7) and (8), where paragraph (1)(a) applies, the court must, unless it considers it unjust to do so, order that the defendant is entitled to-\n\n(a) costs (including any recoverable pre-action costs) from the date on which the relevant period expired; and\n\n(b) interest on those costs.\n\n(4) Subject to paragraph (7), where paragraph (1)(b) applies, the court must, unless it considers it unjust to do so, order that the claimant is entitled to-\n\n(a) interest on the whole or part of any sum of money (excluding interest) awarded, at a rate not exceeding 10% above base rate for some or all of the period starting with the date on which the relevant period expired;\n\n(b) costs (including any recoverable pre-action costs) on the indemnity basis from the date on which the relevant period expired;\n\n(c) interest on those costs at a rate not exceeding 10% above base rate; and\n\n(d) provided that the case has been decided and there has not been a previous order under this sub-paragraph, an additional amount, which shall not exceed £75,000, calculated by applying the prescribed percentage set out below to an amount which is-\n\n(i) the sum awarded to the claimant by the court; or\n\n(ii) where there is no monetary award, the sum awarded to the claimant by the court in respect of costs-\n\n(5) In considering whether it would be unjust to make the orders referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4), the court must take into account all the circumstances of the case including-\n\n(a) the terms of any Part 36 offer;\n\n(b) the stage in the proceedings when any Part 36 offer was made, including in particular how long before the trial started the offer was made;\n\n(c) the information available to the parties at the time when the Part 36 offer was made;\n\n(d) the conduct of the parties with regard to the giving of or refusal to give information for the purposes of enabling the offer to be made or evaluated; and\n\n(e) whether the offer was a genuine attempt to settle the proceedings.\n\n(6) Where the court awards interest under this rule and also awards interest on the same sum and for the same period under any other power, the total rate of interest must not exceed 10% above base rate.\n\n(7) Paragraphs (3) and (4) do not apply to a Part 36 offer-\n\n(a) which has been withdrawn;\n\n(b) which has been changed so that its terms are less advantageous to the offeree where the offeree has beaten the less advantageous offer;\n\n(c) made less than 21 days before trial, unless the court has abridged the relevant period.\n\n(8) Paragraph (3) does not apply to a soft tissue injury claim to which rule 36.21 applies.\n\n(Rule 44.2 requires the court to consider an offer to settle that does not have the costs consequences set out in this Section in deciding what order to make about costs.) Personal injury claims Personal injury claims for future pecuniary loss\n\n36.18\n\n(1) This rule applies to a claim for damages for personal injury which is or includes a claim for future pecuniary loss.\n\n(2) An offer to settle such a claim will not have the consequences set out in this Section unless it is made by way of a Part 36 offer under this rule.\n\n(3) A Part 36 offer to which this rule applies may contain an offer to pay, or an offer to accept-\n\n(a) the whole or part of the damages for future pecuniary loss in the form of-\n\n(i) a lump sum;\n\n(ii) periodical payments; or\n\n(iii) both a lump sum and periodical payments;\n\n(b) the whole or part of any other damages in the form of a lump sum.\n\n(4) A Part 36 offer to which this rule applies-\n\n(a) must state the amount of any offer to pay or to accept the whole or part of any damages in the form of a lump sum;\n\n(b) may state-\n\n(i) what part of the lump sum, if any, relates to damages for future pecuniary loss; and\n\n(ii) what part relates to other damages to be paid or accepted in the form of a lump sum;\n\n(c) must state what part of the offer relates to damages for future pecuniary loss to be paid or accepted in the form of periodical payments and must specify-\n\n(i) the amount and duration of the periodical payments;\n\n(ii) the amount of any payments for substantial capital purchases and when they are to be made; and\n\n(iii) that each amount is to vary by reference to the retail prices index (or to some other named index, or that it is not to vary by reference to any index); and\n\n(d) must state either that any damages which take the form of periodical payments will be funded in a way which ensures that the continuity of payments is reasonably secure in accordance with section 2(4) of the Damages Act 19964 or how such damages are to be paid and how the continuity of their payment is to be secured.\n\n(5) Rule 36.6 applies to the extent that a Part 36 offer by a defendant under this rule includes an offer to pay all or part of any damages in the form of a lump sum.",

I PART 36 OFFERS TO SETTLE\n\nGeneral Scope of this Section\n\n36.2\n\n(1) This Section-\n\n(a)applies to an offer to settle to which Section II of this Part applies, unless otherwise stated; but\n\n(b)does not apply to an offer to settle to which Section III applies.\n\n(2) Nothing in this Section prevents a party making an offer to settle in whatever way that party chooses, but if the offer is not made in accordance with rule 36.5, it will not have the consequences specified in this Section.\n\n(Rule 44.2 requires the court to consider an offer to settle that does not have the costs consequences set out in this Section in deciding what order to make about costs.)\n\n(3) A Part 36 offer may be made in respect of the whole, or part of, or any issue that arises in-\n\n(a) a claim, counterclaim or other additional claim; or\n\n(b) an appeal or cross-appeal from a decision made at a trial.\n\n(Rules 20.2 and 20.3 provide that counterclaims and other additional claims are treated as claims and that references to a claimant or a defendant include a party bringing or defending an additional claim.) Definitions\n\n36.3 In this Section-\n\n(a) the party who makes an offer is the \"offeror\";\n\n(b) the party to whom an offer is made is the \"offeree\";\n\n(c) a \"trial\" means any trial in a case whether it is a trial of all issues or a trial of liability, quantum or some other issue in the case;\n\n(d) a trial is \"in progress\" from the time when it starts until the time when judgment is given or handed down;\n\n(e) a case is \"decided\" when all issues in the case have been determined, whether at one or more trials;\n\n(f) \"trial judge\" includes the judge (if any) allocated in advance to conduct a trial; and\n\n(g) \"the relevant period\" means-\n\n(i) in the case of an offer made not less than 21 days before a trial, the period specified under rule 36.5(1)(c) or such longer period as the parties agree;\n\n(ii) otherwise, the period up to the end of such trial. Application of Part 36 to appeals\n\n36.4\n\n(1) Except where a Part 36 offer is made in appeal proceedings, it shall have the consequences set out in this Section only in relation to the costs of the proceedings in respect of which it is made, and not in relation to the costs of any appeal from a decision in those proceedings.\n\n(2) Where a Part 36 offer is made in appeal proceedings, references in this Section to a term in the first column below shall be treated, unless the context requires otherwise, as references to the corresponding term in the second column- Making offers Form and content of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.5\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer must-\n\n(a) be in writing;\n\n(b) make clear that it is made pursuant to Part 36;\n\n(c) specify a period of not less than 21 days within which the defendant will be liable for the claimant's costs in accordance with rule 36.13 or 36.23 if the offer is accepted;\n\n(d) state whether it relates to the whole of the claim or to part of it or to an issue that arises in it and if so to which part or issue; and\n\n(e) state whether it takes into account any counterclaim.\n\n(Rule 36.7 makes provision for when a Part 36 offer is made.)\n\n(2) Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply if the offer is made less than 21 days before the start of a trial.\n\n(3) In appropriate cases, a Part 36 offer must contain such further information as is required by rule 36.18 (personal injury claims for future pecuniary loss), rule 36.19 (offer to settle a claim for provisional damages), and rule 36.20 (deduction of benefits).\n\n(4) A Part 36 offer which offers to pay or offers to accept a sum of money will be treated as inclusive of all interest until-\n\n(a) the date on which the period specified under rule 36.5(1)(c) expires; or\n\n(b) if rule 36.5(2) applies, a date 21 days after the date the offer was made.\n\n(5) A Part 36 offer to accept a sum of money may make provision for accrual of interest on such sum after the date specified in paragraph (4). If such an offer does not make any such provision, it shall be treated as inclusive of all interest up to the date of acceptance if it is later accepted. Part 36 offers - defendant's offer\n\n36.6\n\n(1) Subject to rules 36.18(3) and 36.19(1), a Part 36 offer by a defendant to pay a sum of money in settlement of a claim must be an offer to pay a single sum of money.\n\n(2) A defendant's offer that includes an offer to pay all or part of the sum at a date later than 14 days following the date of acceptance will not be treated as a Part 36 offer unless the offeree accepts the offer. Time when a Part 36 offer is made\n\n36.7\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer may be made at any time, including before the commencement of proceedings.\n\n(2) A Part 36 offer is made when it is served on the offeree.\n\n(Part 6 provides detailed rules about service of documents.)\n\nClarifying, withdrawing and changing the terms of offers Clarification of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.8\n\n(1) The offeree may, within 7 days of a Part 36 offer being made, request the offeror to clarify the offer.\n\n(2) If the offeror does not give the clarification requested under paragraph (1) within 7 days of receiving the request, the offeree may, unless the trial has started, apply for an order that the offeror do so.\n\n(Part 23 contains provisions about making an application to the court.)\n\n(3) If the court makes an order under paragraph (2), it must specify the date when the Part 36 offer is to be treated as having been made. Withdrawing or changing the terms of a Part 36 offer generally\n\n36.9\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer can only be withdrawn, or its terms changed, if the offeree has not previously served notice of acceptance.\n\n(2) The offeror withdraws the offer or changes its terms by serving written notice of the withdrawal or change of terms on the offeree.\n\n(Rule 36.17(7) deals with the costs consequences following judgment of an offer which is withdrawn.)\n\n(3) Subject to rule 36.10, such notice of withdrawal or change of terms takes effect when it is served on the offeree.\n\n(Rule 36.10 makes provision about when permission is required to withdraw or change the terms of an offer before the expiry of the relevant period.)\n\n(4) Subject to paragraph (1), after expiry of the relevant period-\n\n(a) the offeror may withdraw the offer or change its terms without the permission of the court; or\n\n(b) the offer may be automatically withdrawn in accordance with its terms.\n\n(5) Where the offeror changes the terms of a Part 36 offer to make it more advantageous to the offeree-\n\n(a) such improved offer shall be treated, not as the withdrawal of the original offer; but as the making of a new Part 36 offer on the improved terms; and\n\n(b) subject to rule 36.5(2), the period specified under rule 36.5(1)(c) shall be 21 days or such longer period (if any) identified in the written notice referred to in paragraph (2). Withdrawing or changing the terms of a Part 36 offer before the expiry of the relevant period\n\n36.10\n\n(1) Subject to rule 36.9(1), this rule applies where the offeror serves notice before expiry of the relevant period of withdrawal of the offer or change of its terms to be less advantageous to the offeree.\n\n(2) Where this rule applies-\n\n(a) if the offeree has not served notice of acceptance of the original offer by the expiry of the relevant period, the offeror's notice has effect on the expiry of that period; and\n\n(b) if the offeree serves notice of acceptance of the original offer before the expiry of the relevant period, that acceptance has effect unless the offeror applies to the court for permission to withdraw the offer or to change its terms-\n\n(i) within 7 days of the offeree's notice of acceptance; or\n\n(ii) if earlier, before the first day of trial.\n\n(3) On an application under paragraph (2)(b), the court may give permission for the original offer to be withdrawn or its terms changed if satisfied that there has been a change of circumstances since the making of the original offer and that it is in the interests of justice to give permission. Accepting offers Acceptance of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.11\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer is accepted by serving written notice of acceptance on the offeror.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4) and to rule 36.12, a Part 36 offer may be accepted at any time (whether or not the offeree has subsequently made a different offer), unless it has already been withdrawn.\n\n(Rule 21.10 deals with compromise, etc. by or on behalf of a child or protected party.)\n\n(Rules 36.9 and 36.10 deal with withdrawal of Part 36 offers.)\n\n(3) The court's permission is required to accept a Part 36 offer where-\n\n(a) rule 36.15(4) applies;\n\n(b) rule 36.20(3)(b) applies, the relevant period has expired and further deductible amounts have been paid to the claimant since the date of the offer;\n\n(c) an apportionment is required under rule 41.3 A; or\n\n(d) a trial is in progress.\n\n(Rule 36.15 deals with offers by some but not all of multiple defendants.)\n\n(Rule 36.20 defines \"deductible amounts\".)\n\n(Rule 41.3 A requires an apportionment in proceedings under the Fatal Accidents Act 19761 and Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 19342.)\n\n(4) Where the court gives permission under paragraph (3), unless all the parties have agreed costs, the court must make an order dealing with costs, and may order that the costs consequences set out in rule 36.13 apply. Acceptance of a Part 36 offer in a split-trial case\n\n36.12\n\n(1) This rule applies in any case where there has been a trial but the case has not been decided within the meaning of rule 36.3.\n\n(2) Any Part 36 offer which relates only to parts of the claim or issues that have already been decided can no longer be accepted.\n\n(3) Subject to paragraph (2) and unless the parties agree, any other Part 36 offer cannot be accepted earlier than 7 clear days after judgment is given or handed down in such trial. Costs consequences of acceptance of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.13\n\n(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (4) and to rule 36.23, where a Part 36 offer is accepted within the relevant period the claimant will be entitled to the costs of the proceedings (including their recoverable pre-action costs) up to the date on which notice of acceptance was served on the offeror.\n\n(Rule 36.20 makes provision for the costs consequences of accepting a Part 36 offer in certain personal injury claims where the claim no longer proceeds under the RTA or EL/PL Protocol.)\n\n(2) Where-\n\n(a) a defendant's Part 36 offer relates to part only of the claim; and\n\n(b) at the time of serving notice of acceptance within the relevant period the claimant abandons the balance of the claim,\n\nthe claimant will only be entitled to the costs of such part of the claim unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(3) Except where the recoverable costs are fixed by these Rules, costs under paragraphs (1) and (2) are to be assessed on the standard basis if the amount of costs is not agreed.\n\n(Rule 44.3(2) explains the standard basis for the assessment of costs.)\n\n(Rule 44.9 contains provisions about when a costs order is deemed to have been made and applying for an order under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 20073.)\n\n(Part 45 provides for fixed costs in certain classes of case.)\n\n(4) Where-\n\n(a) a Part 36 offer which was made less than 21 days before the start of a trial is accepted; or\n\n(b) a Part 36 offer which relates to the whole of the claim is accepted after expiry of the relevant period; or\n\n(c) subject to paragraph (2), a Part 36 offer which does not relate to the whole of the claim is accepted at any time,\n\nthe liability for costs must be determined by the court unless the parties have agreed the costs.\n\n(5) Where paragraph (4)(b) applies but the parties cannot agree the liability for costs, the court must, unless it considers it unjust to do so, order that-\n\n(a) the claimant be awarded costs up to the date on which the relevant period expired; and\n\n(b) the offeree do pay the offeror's costs for the period from the date of expiry of the relevant period to the date of acceptance.\n\n(6) In considering whether it would be unjust to make the orders specified in paragraph (5), the court must take into account all the circumstances of the case including the matters listed in rule 36.17(5).\n\n(7) The claimant's costs include any costs incurred in dealing with the defendant's counterclaim if the Part 36 offer states that it takes it into account. Other effects of acceptance of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.14\n\n(1) If a Part 36 offer is accepted, the claim will be stayed.\n\n(2) In the case of acceptance of a Part 36 offer which relates to the whole claim, the stay will be upon the terms of the offer.\n\n(3) If a Part 36 offer which relates to part only of the claim is accepted, the claim will be stayed as to that part upon the terms of the offer.\n\n(4) If the approval of the court is required before a settlement can be binding, any stay which would otherwise arise on the acceptance of a Part 36 offer will take effect only when that approval has been given.\n\n(5) Any stay arising under this rule will not affect the power of the court-\n\n(a) to enforce the terms of a Part 36 offer; or\n\n(b) to deal with any question of costs (including interest on costs) relating to the proceedings.\n\n(6) Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, where a Part 36 offer that is or includes an offer to pay or accept a single sum of money is accepted, that sum must be paid to the claimant within 14 days of the date of-\n\n(a) acceptance; or\n\n(b) the order when the court makes an order under rule 41.2 (order for an award of provisional damages) or rule 41.8 (order for an award of periodical payments), unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(7) If such sum is not paid within 14 days of acceptance of the offer, or such other period as has been agreed, the claimant may enter judgment for the unpaid sum.\n\n(8) Where-\n\n(a) a Part 36 offer (or part of a Part 36 offer) which is not an offer to which paragraph (6) applies is accepted; and\n\n(b) a party alleges that the other party has not honoured the terms of the offer,\n\nthat party may apply to enforce the terms of the offer without the need for a new claim. Acceptance of a Part 36 offer made by one or more, but not all, defendants\n\n36.15\n\n(1) This rule applies where the claimant wishes to accept a Part 36 offer made by one or more, but not all, of a number of defendants.\n\n(2) If the defendants are sued jointly or in the alternative, the claimant may accept the offer if-\n\n(a) the claimant discontinues the claim against those defendants who have not made the offer; and\n\n(b) those defendants give written consent to the acceptance of the offer.\n\n(3) If the claimant alleges that the defendants have a several liability(GL)to the claimant, the claimant may-\n\n(a) accept the offer; and\n\n(b) continue with the claims against the other defendants if entitled to do so.\n\n(4) In all other cases the claimant must apply to the court for permission to accept the Part 36 offer. Unaccepted offers Restriction on disclosure of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.16\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer will be treated as \"without prejudice except as to costs\".\n\n(2) The fact that a Part 36 offer has been made and the terms of such offer must not be communicated to the trial judge until the case has been decided.\n\n(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply-\n\n(a) where the defence of tender before claim has been raised;\n\n(b) where the proceedings have been stayed under rule 36.14 following acceptance of a Part 36 offer;\n\n(c) where the offeror and the offeree agree in writing that it should not apply; or\n\n(d) where, although the case has not been decided-\n\n(i) any part of, or issue in, the case has been decided; and\n\n(ii) the Part 36 offer relates only to parts or issues that have been decided.\n\n(4) In a case to which paragraph (3)(d)(i) applies, the trial judge-\n\n(a) may be told whether or not there are Part 36 offers other than those referred to in paragraph (3)(d)(ii); but\n\n(b) must not be told the terms of any such other offers unless any of paragraphs (3)(a) to (c) applies. Costs consequences following judgment\n\n36.17\n\n(1) Subject to rule 36.24, this rule applies where upon judgment being entered-\n\n(a) a claimant fails to obtain a judgment more advantageous than a defendant's Part 36 offer; or\n\n(b) judgment against the defendant is at least as advantageous to the claimant as the proposals contained in a claimant's Part 36 offer.\n\n(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), in relation to any money claim or money element of a claim, \"more advantageous\" means better in money terms by any amount, however small, and \"at least as advantageous\" shall be construed accordingly.\n\n(3) Subject to paragraphs (7) and (8), where paragraph (1)(a) applies, the court must, unless it considers it unjust to do so, order that the defendant is entitled to-\n\n(a) costs (including any recoverable pre-action costs) from the date on which the relevant period expired; and\n\n(b) interest on those costs.\n\n(4) Subject to paragraph (7), where paragraph (1)(b) applies, the court must, unless it considers it unjust to do so, order that the claimant is entitled to-\n\n(a) interest on the whole or part of any sum of money (excluding interest) awarded, at a rate not exceeding 10% above base rate for some or all of the period starting with the date on which the relevant period expired;\n\n(b) costs (including any recoverable pre-action costs) on the indemnity basis from the date on which the relevant period expired;\n\n(c) interest on those costs at a rate not exceeding 10% above base rate; and\n\n(d) provided that the case has been decided and there has not been a previous order under this sub-paragraph, an additional amount, which shall not exceed £75,000, calculated by applying the prescribed percentage set out below to an amount which is-\n\n(i) the sum awarded to the claimant by the court; or\n\n(ii) where there is no monetary award, the sum awarded to the claimant by the court in respect of costs-\n\n(5) In considering whether it would be unjust to make the orders referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4), the court must take into account all the circumstances of the case including-\n\n(a) the terms of any Part 36 offer;\n\n(b) the stage in the proceedings when any Part 36 offer was made, including in particular how long before the trial started the offer was made;\n\n(c) the information available to the parties at the time when the Part 36 offer was made;\n\n(d) the conduct of the parties with regard to the giving of or refusal to give information for the purposes of enabling the offer to be made or evaluated; and\n\n(e) whether the offer was a genuine attempt to settle the proceedings.\n\n(6) Where the court awards interest under this rule and also awards interest on the same sum and for the same period under any other power, the total rate of interest must not exceed 10% above base rate.\n\n(7) Paragraphs (3) and (4) do not apply to a Part 36 offer-\n\n(a) which has been withdrawn;\n\n(b) which has been changed so that its terms are less advantageous to the offeree where the offeree has beaten the less advantageous offer;\n\n(c) made less than 21 days before trial, unless the court has abridged the relevant period.\n\n(8) Paragraph (3) does not apply to a soft tissue injury claim to which rule 36.21 applies.\n\n(Rule 44.2 requires the court to consider an offer to settle that does not have the costs consequences set out in this Section in deciding what order to make about costs.) Personal injury claims Personal injury claims for future pecuniary loss\n\n36.18\n\n(1) This rule applies to a claim for damages for personal injury which is or includes a claim for future pecuniary loss.\n\n(2) An offer to settle such a claim will not have the consequences set out in this Section unless it is made by way of a Part 36 offer under this rule.\n\n(3) A Part 36 offer to which this rule applies may contain an offer to pay, or an offer to accept-\n\n(a) the whole or part of the damages for future pecuniary loss in the form of-\n\n(i) a lump sum;\n\n(ii) periodical payments; or\n\n(iii) both a lump sum and periodical payments;\n\n(b) the whole or part of any other damages in the form of a lump sum.\n\n(4) A Part 36 offer to which this rule applies-\n\n(a) must state the amount of any offer to pay or to accept the whole or part of any damages in the form of a lump sum;\n\n(b) may state-\n\n(i) what part of the lump sum, if any, relates to damages for future pecuniary loss; and\n\n(ii) what part relates to other damages to be paid or accepted in the form of a lump sum;\n\n(c) must state what part of the offer relates to damages for future pecuniary loss to be paid or accepted in the form of periodical payments and must specify-\n\n(i) the amount and duration of the periodical payments;\n\n(ii) the amount of any payments for substantial capital purchases and when they are to be made; and\n\n(iii) that each amount is to vary by reference to the retail prices index (or to some other named index, or that it is not to vary by reference to any index); and\n\n(d) must state either that any damages which take the form of periodical payments will be funded in a way which ensures that the continuity of payments is reasonably secure in accordance with section 2(4) of the Damages Act 19964 or how such damages are to be paid and how the continuity of their payment is to be secured.\n\n(5) Rule 36.6 applies to the extent that a Part 36 offer by a defendant under this rule includes an offer to pay all or part of any damages in the form of a lump sum.",

Schedule 1 to the 2008 Regulations modifies section 15 of the 1997 Act in relation to lump sum payments and provides that the court must specify the compensation payment attributable to each or any dependant who has received a lump sum payment.)\n\n(9) Where-\n\n(a) further deductible amounts have accrued since the Part 36 offer was made; and\n\n(b) the court gives permission to accept the Part 36 offer,\n\nthe court may direct that the amount of the offer payable to the offeree shall be reduced by a sum equivalent to the deductible amounts paid to the claimant since the date of the offer.\n\n(Rule 36.11(3)(b) states that permission is required to accept an offer where the relevant period has expired and further deductible amounts have been paid to the claimant.) Miscellaneous Cases in which the offeror's costs have been limited to court fees\n\n36.21\n\n(1) This rule applies in any case where the offeror is treated as having filed a costs budget limited to applicable court fees, or is otherwise limited in their recovery of costs to such fees.\n\n(Rule 3.14 provides that a litigant may be treated as having filed a budget limited to court fees for failure to file a budget.)\n\n(2) \"Costs\" in rules 36.13(5)(b), 36.17(3)(a) and 36.17(4)(b) shall mean-\n\n(a) in respect of those costs subject to any such limitation, 50% of the costs assessed without reference to the limitation; together with\n\n(b) any other recoverable costs.
