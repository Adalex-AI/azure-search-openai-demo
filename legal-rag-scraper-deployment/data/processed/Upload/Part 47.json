The matter will then proceed under rule 47.14 without modification.\n\n(7) When a provisional assessment has been carried out, the court will send a copy of the bill, as provisionally assessed, to each party with a notice stating that any party who wishes to challenge any aspect of the provisional assessment must, within 21 days of the receipt of the notice, file and serve on all other parties a written request for an oral hearing. If no such request is filed and served within that period, the provisional assessment shall be binding upon the parties, save in exceptional circumstances.\n\n(8) The written request referred to in paragraph (7) must -\n\n(a) identify the item or items in the court's provisional assessment which are sought to be reviewed at the hearing; and\n\n(b) provide a time estimate for the hearing.\n\n(9) The court then will fix a date for the hearing and give at least 14 days' notice of the time and place of the hearing to all parties.\n\n(10) Any party which has requested an oral hearing, will pay the costs of and incidental to that hearing unless -\n\n(a) it achieves an adjustment in its own favour by 20% or more of the sum provisionally assessed; or\n\n(b) the court otherwise

period for filing the completed bill is 14 days after the end of the detailed assessment hearing.\n\n(3) When a completed bill is filed the court will issue a final costs certificate and serve it on the parties to the detailed assessment proceedings.\n\n(4) Paragraph (3) is subject to any order made by the court that a certificate is not to be issued until other costs have been paid.\n\n(5) A final costs certificate will include an order to pay the costs to which it relates, unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(Practice Direction 47 deals with the form of a final costs certificate.)\n\n(6) Where the court issues a final costs certificate in detailed assessment proceedings pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act, the receiving party must send a copy

for detailed assessment on the LSC funded client, the assisted person or the person to whom legal aid is provided, if notice of that person's interest has been given to the court in accordance with community legal service or legal aid regulations.\n\n(4) Where the solicitor has certified that the LSC funded client or that person wishes to attend an assessment hearing, the court will, on receipt of the request for assessment, fix a date for the assessment hearing.\n\n(5) Where paragraph (3) does not apply, the court will, on receipt of the request for assessment provisionally assess the costs without the attendance of the solicitor, unless it considers that a hearing is necessary.\n\n(6) After the court has provisionally assessed the bill, it will return the bill to the solicitor.\n\n(7) The court will fix a date for an assessment hearing if the solicitor informs the court, within 14 days after receiving the provisionally assessed bill, that the solicitor wants the court to hold such a hearing.\n\n---\n\nDetailed assessment procedure where costs are payable out of a fund other than the community legal service fund\n\n47.19\n\n(1) Where the court is to assess costs which are

costs of the detailed assessment proceedings except where -\n\n(a) the provisions of any Act, any of these Rules or any relevant practice direction provide otherwise; or\n\n(b) the court makes some other order in relation to all or part of the costs of the detailed assessment proceedings.\n\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply where the receiving party has pro bono representation in the detailed assessment proceedings but that party may apply for an order in respect of that representation under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act.\n\n(3) In deciding whether to make some other order, the court must have regard to all the circumstances, including -\n\n(a) the conduct of all the parties;\n\n(b) the amount, if any, by which the bill of costs has been reduced; and\n\n(c) whether it was reasonable for a party to claim the costs of a particular item or to dispute that item.\n\n(4) The provisions of Part 36 apply to the costs of detailed assessment proceedings with the following modifications

progress\" from the time when it starts until the bill of costs has been assessed or agreed;\n\n(d) for rule 36.14(7) substitute \"If such sum is not paid within 14 days of acceptance of the offer, or such other period as has been agreed, the receiving party may apply for a final costs certificate for the unpaid sum.\";\n\n(e) a reference to 'judgment being entered' is to the completion of the detailed assessment, and references to a 'judgment' being advantageous or otherwise are to the outcome of the detailed assessment.\n\n(5) The court will usually summarily assess the costs of detailed assessment proceedings at the conclusion of those proceedings.\n\n(6) Unless the court otherwise orders, interest on the costs of detailed assessment proceedings will run from the date of default, interim or final costs certificate, as the case may be.\n\n(7) For the purposes of rule 36.17, detailed assessment proceedings are to be regarded as an independent claim.\n\n---\n\nVIII APPEALS FROM

those proceedings.\n\nCourt to hear appeal\n\n47.22 An appeal against a decision of an authorised court officer lies to a costs judge or a district judge of the High Court.\n\n---\n\nAppeal
