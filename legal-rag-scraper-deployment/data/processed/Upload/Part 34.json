and\n\n(b) for a party to obtain evidence before a hearing to be used at the hearing.\n\n(2) In this Section, reference to a hearing includes a reference to the trial.\n\n---\n\nWitness summonses\n\n34.2\n\n(1) A witness summons is a document issued by the court requiring a witness to -\n\n(a) attend court to give evidence; or\n\n(b) produce documents to the court.\n\n(2) A witness summons must be in the relevant practice form.\n\n(3) There must be a separate witness summons for each witness.\n\n(4) A witness summons may require a witness to produce documents to the court either -\n\n(a) on the date fixed for a hearing; or\n\n(b) on such date as the court may direct.\n\n(5) The only documents that a summons under this rule can require a person to produce before a hearing are documents which that person could be required to produce at the hearing.\n\n---\n\nIssue of a witness summons\n\n34.3\n\n(1) A witness summons is issued on the date entered on the summons by the court.\n\n(2) A party must obtain permission from the court where he wishes to -\n\n(a) have a summons issued less than 7 days before the date of the trial;\n\n(b) have a summons issued for a witness to attend court to give evidence or to produce documents on any date except the date fixed for the trial; or\n\n(c) have a summons issued for a witness to attend court to give evidence or to produce documents at any hearing except the trial.\n\n(3) A witness summons must be issued by -\n\n(a) the court where the case is proceeding;

and\n\n(b) requires the witness to attend court to give evidence,\n\nis binding until the conclusion of the hearing at which the attendance of the witness is required.\n\n---\n\nWho is to serve a witness summons\n\n34.6\n\n(1) A witness summons is to be served by the court unless the party on whose behalf it is issued indicates in writing, when he asks the court to issue the summons, that he wishes to serve it himself.\n\n(2) Where the court is to serve the witness summons, the party on whose behalf it is issued must deposit, in the court office, the money to be paid or offered to the witness under rule 34.7.\n\n---\n\nRight of witness to travelling expenses and compensation for loss of time\n\n34.7\n\nAt the time of service of a witness summons the witness must be offered or paid -\n\n(a) a sum reasonably sufficient to cover his expenses in travelling to and from the court; and\n\n(b) such sum by way of compensation for loss of time as may be specified in Practice Direction 34 A.\n\n---\n\nFines imposed under section 55 of the County Courts Act 1984\n\n34.7 A\n\nIf a person has failed to comply with an order under section 55 of the County Courts Act 1984 but can demonstrate any reason why they should not be (or should not have been) fined for failure to comply with the order, the court may direct that that person give evidence by witness statement, affidavit or otherwise.\n\n(Part 70 contains general rules about fines imposed under the County Courts Act 1984.)\n\n---\n\nEvidence by deposition\n\n34.8\n\n(1) A party may apply for an order for a person to be examined before the hearing takes place.\n\n(2) A person from whom evidence is to be obtained following an order under this rule is referred to as a 'deponent' and the evidence is referred to as a 'deposition'.\n\n(3) An order under this rule shall be for a deponent to be examined on oath before -\n\n(a) a judge;\n\n(b) an examiner of the court; or\n\n(c) such other person as the court appoints.\n\n(Rule 34.15 makes provision for the appointment of examiners of the court)\n\n(4) The order may require the production of any document which the court considers is necessary for the purposes of the examination.\n\n(5) The order must state the date, time and place of the examination.\n\n(6) At the time of service of the order the deponent must be offered or paid -\n\n(a) a sum reasonably sufficient to cover his expenses in travelling to and from the place of examination; and\n\n(b) such sum by way of compensation for loss of time as may be specified in Practice Direction 34 A.\n\n(7) Where the court makes an order for a deposition to be taken, it may also order the party who obtained the order to serve a witness statement or witness summary in relation to the evidence to be given by the person to be examined.\n\n(Part 32 contains the general rules about witness statements and witness summaries)\n\n---\n\nConduct of examination\n\n34.9\n\n(1) Subject to any directions contained in the order for examination, the examination must be conducted in the same way as if the witness were giving evidence at a trial.\n\n(2) If all the parties are present, the examiner may conduct the examination of a person not named in the order for examination if all the parties and the person to be examined consent.\n\n(3) The examiner may conduct the examination in private if he considers it appropriate to do so.\n\n(4) The examiner must ensure that the evidence given by the witness is recorded in full.\n\n(5) The examiner must send a copy of the deposition -\n\n(a) to the person who obtained the order for the examination of the witness;
