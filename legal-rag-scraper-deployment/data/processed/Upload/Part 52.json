        "content": "Document: Part 52 – Appeals\nSection: VII REOPENING FINAL APPEALS Reopening of final appeals\nPart 2 of 4\n==================================================\n(2) In an appeal against a decision made in an Aarhus Convention claim to which rules 46.26 to 46.28 apply, the court must-\n\n(a) consider whether the costs of the proceedings will be prohibitively expensive for a party who was a claimant; and\n\n(b) if they will be, make an order limiting the recoverable costs to the extent necessary to prevent this.\n\n(3) When the court considers the financial resources of a party for the purposes of this rule, it must have regard to any financial support which any person has provided or is likely to provide to that party. Appeal court's powers\n\n52.20\n\n(1) In relation to an appeal the appeal court has all the powers of the lower court.\n\n(Rule 52.1(4) provides that this Part is subject to any enactment that sets out special provisions with regard to any particular category of appeal. Where such an enactment gives a statutory power to a tribunal, person or other body, it may be the case that the appeal court may not exercise that power on an appeal.)\n\n(2) The appeal court has power to-\n\n(a) affirm, set aside or vary any order or judgment made or given by the lower court;\n\n(b) refer any claim or issue for determination by the lower court;\n\n(c) order a new trial or hearing;\n\n(d) make orders for the payment of interest;\n\n(e) make a costs order.\n\n(3) In an appeal from a claim tried with a jury the Court of Appeal may, instead of ordering a new trial-\n\n(a) make an order for damages; or\n\n(b) vary an award of damages made by the jury.\n\n(4) The appeal court may exercise its powers in relation to the whole or part of an order of the lower court.\n\n(Part 3 contains general rules about the court's case management powers.)\n\n(5) If the appeal court-\n\n(a) refuses an application for permission to appeal;\n\n(b) strikes out an appellant's notice; or\n\n(c) dismisses an appeal,\n\nand it considers that the application, the appellant's notice or the appeal is totally without merit, the provisions of paragraph (6) must be complied with.\n\n(6) Where paragraph (5) applies-\n\n(a) the court's order must record the fact that it considers the application, the appellant's notice or the appeal to be totally without merit; and\n\n(b) the court must at the same time consider whether it is appropriate to make a civil restraint order. Hearing of appeals\n\n52.21\n\n(1) Every appeal will be limited to a review of the decision of the lower court unless-\n\n(a) a practice direction makes different provision for a particular category of appeal; or\n\n(b) the court considers that in the circumstances of an individual appeal it would be in the interests of justice to hold a re-hearing.\n\n(2) Unless it orders otherwise, the appeal court will not receive-\n\n(a) oral evidence; or\n\n(b) evidence which was not before the lower court.\n\n(3) The appeal court will allow an appeal where the decision of the lower court was-\n\n(a) wrong; or\n\n(b) unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity in the proceedings in the lower court.\n\n(4) The appeal court may draw any inference of fact which it considers justified on the evidence.\n\n(5) At the hearing of the appeal, a party may not rely on a matter not contained in that party's appeal notice unless the court gives permission. Non-disclosure of Part 36 offers and payments\n\n52.22\n\n(1) Unless the appeal court otherwise orders, the fact that a Part 36 offer or payment into court has been made must not be disclosed to any judge of the appeal court who is to hear or determine-\n\n(a) an application for permission to appeal\n\n(b) an appeal;\n\nuntil all questions (other than costs) have been determined.\n\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply if the Part 36 offer or payment into court is relevant to the substance of the appeal.\n\n(3) Paragraph (1) does not prevent disclosure in any application in the appeal proceedings if disclosure of the fact that a Part 36 offer or payment into court has been made is properly relevant to the matter to be decided.\n\n(Rule 36.4 has the effect that a Part 36 offer made in proceedings at first instance will not have consequences in any appeal proceedings. Therefore, a fresh Part 36 offer needs to be made in appeal proceedings. However, this rule applies to a Part 36 offer whether made in the original proceedings or in the appeal.) V SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE COURT OF APPEAL Assignment of appeals to the Court of Appeal\n\n52.23\n\n(1) Where the court from or to which an appeal is made or from which permission to appeal is sought (\"the relevant court\") considers that-\n\n(a) an appeal which is to be heard by the County Court or the High Court would raise an important point of principle or practice; or\n\n(b) there is some other compelling reason for the Court of Appeal to hear it,\n\nthe relevant court may order the appeal to be transferred to the Court of Appeal.\n\n(The Master of the Rolls has the separate statutory power to direct that an appeal which would be heard by the County Court or the High Court should be heard instead by the Court of Appeal - see section 57 of the Access to Justice Act 19994.)\n\n(2) The Master of the Rolls or the Court of Appeal may remit an appeal to the court in which the original appeal was or would have been brought.

Paragraphs (5) and (6) of this rule provide the procedure for the calling into question of such decisions.) VI SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO STATUTORY APPEALS\n\nStatutory appeals - court's power to hear any person\n\n52.25\n\n(1) In a statutory appeal any person may apply for permission-\n\n(a) to file evidence; or\n\n(b) to make representations at the appeal hearing.\n\n(2) An application under paragraph (1) must be made promptly.
