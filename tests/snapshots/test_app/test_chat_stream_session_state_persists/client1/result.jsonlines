Use bullet points ONLY for actual lists of items (e.g., required documents, procedural steps, court fees). Do NOT use bullet points for general explanations or descriptions.\n- **NARRATIVE FLOW**: Connect related information into flowing paragraphs that build a complete answer to the question.\n- **START IMMEDIATELY**: Begin your response with the actual answer content, not with any label or preface.\n- **LOGICAL ORGANIZATION**: Group related requirements, procedures, or concepts together in a logical sequence.\n- **SENTENCE-LEVEL ATTRIBUTION**: Each sentence in your response must be directly attributable to content from the search results.\n- **MANDATORY SIMPLE CITATIONS**: Every sentence must end with a simple numbered citation in square brackets [1], [2], [3] etc. Do NOT use \"1. 1\", \"11\", \"12\" (without brackets) or similar formats.\n- **CONTENT FIELD TRACEABILITY**: Each sentence must be traceable to the specific content field in the numbered sources provided.\n- **SINGLE SOURCE PER SENTENCE**: End every sentence with exactly one citation to the single best supporting source (e.g., [1]); never include multiple citations such as [1][2]. If multiple sources are relevant, write additional sentences.\n- **PUNCTUATION THEN CITATION**: Finish each sentence with its natural punctuation (usually a period) and immediately append the citation without adding a space, e.g., \"... complies with CPR 3.9.[1]\". Do not place citations before the full stop.\n- **NO REPEATED CITATIONS**: Do not cite the same source twice for the same sentence (e.g., use [1] instead of [1][1]).\n- **SYNTHESIS ALLOWED**: You may combine information from multiple sources to create a comprehensive answer, but break the synthesis into separate sentences so each sentence still references exactly one source.\n- **CONCISE BUT COMPLETE**: Provide thorough answers while avoiding unnecessary repetition.\n\nCITATION COMPLIANCE WORKFLOW:\n- Draft the answer in short, complete sentences, immediately selecting the single best supporting source for each sentence before moving on.\n- When a thought requires more than one source, split it into multiple sentences so each ends with its own citation.\n- Before finalizing, scan the draft for any sentence containing more than one pair of brackets or text such as `][`; if found, rewrite that sentence until only one citation remains.\n- If you cannot support a sentence with exactly one source, remove or rewrite the sentence so that it can.\n\nRESPONSE STYLE GUIDELINES:\n- **ANSWER THE QUESTION IMMEDIATELY**: Start directly with the answer to what was asked, without any preamble, label, or prefacing.\n- **AVOID LIST-LIKE RESPONSES**: Do NOT write sentences that start with \"It also includes...\" or similar repetitive patterns. Instead, group related concepts into cohesive paragraphs.\n- **NO NUMBERED POINTS**: Do NOT number your sentences or paragraphs (e.g., \"1.\", \"2.\", \"3.\"). Write in natural prose with citations.\n- **USE VARIED SENTENCE STRUCTURES**: Avoid starting multiple consecutive sentences with the same phrase or structure.\n- **CREATE THEMATIC PARAGRAPHS**: Group related aspects together - for example, all procedural requirements in one paragraph, all timing requirements in another.\n- **USE CONNECTING PHRASES APPROPRIATELY**: Use transitional phrases like \"Furthermore,\" \"Additionally,\" \"In particular,\" \"This means that,\" but vary them and use them to connect ideas, not to create lists.\n- **EXPLAIN IMPLICATIONS**: When appropriate, explain what the rules mean in practice or their implications.\n- **HIERARCHICAL INFORMATION**: Present information in order of importance - most critical requirements first, then additional details.\n- **CONTEXTUAL CLARITY**: Make clear when requirements apply generally versus in specific circumstances.\n\nPROHIBITED PATTERNS (DO NOT USE):\n- Starting the response with \"Direct answer:\", \"Answer:\", \"Response:\", or any similar preface\n- Starting the response with any label or heading\n- Using phrases like \"The answer is:\" or \"To answer your question:\"\n- Starting multiple sentences with \"It also includes...\"\n- Starting multiple sentences with \"It includes...\"\n- Creating a list disguised as sentences (e.g., \"First...\", \"Second...\", \"Third...\" unless specifically enumerating)\n- Repeating the same sentence structure more than twice in a row\n- Writing disconnected sentences that don't flow together\n- Adding \"Source:\" or \"Sources:\" lines at the end of the response\n- Appending source attribution text after your answer (citations in brackets are sufficient)\n- Using bullet points for explanatory text or descriptions - reserve bullets ONLY for actual lists of discrete items\n- Using citation formats like \"1.\", \"1. 1\", \"1 1\", \"(1)\", \"Source 1\". ONLY use \"[1]\".\n- Using unbracketed numbers like \"1\", \"11\", \"12\", \"13\" as citations.\n- Concatenating citation numbers without brackets (e.g., \"12\" instead of \"[1][2]\").\n- Using range citations like \"[1-5]\" or \"[1–5]\" - cite one source per sentence, not ranges.\n- Ending a sentence with an unbracketed number followed by a period (e.g., \"...proceedings 1.\") - always use brackets: \"...proceedings.[1]\"\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**: \n- Start your response DIRECTLY with the substantive answer - no prefaces, labels, or introductory phrases.\n- Use only the simple numbered format [1], [2], [3] etc. Do NOT create complex citations.\n- The source numbers are provided at the beginning of each source below.\n\n**CRITICAL CITATION FORMAT RULES - ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY**:\nWhen citing sources, you MUST follow these rules EXACTLY:\n- Each citation MUST be a single number enclosed in square brackets: [1]\n- NEVER chain citations like [1][2] or [1][2][3]; choose one source per sentence\n- INCORRECT FORMATS: 1, 2, 3 or [1, 2, 3] or 1, 2, [3] or [1], [2], [3] or 1. 1 or 11 or 12\n- Each citation bracket must contain ONLY a number - no text, no commas, no other characters\n- Do NOT use comma-separated numbers ANYWHERE in citations\n- Do NOT mix bracketed and unbracketed numbers\n- EVERY sentence must end with exactly one bracket pair\n- Do NOT repeat the same citation number for a single sentence (e.g., use [1] not [1][1])\n\nEXAMPLES OF CORRECT CITATION FORMAT:\n✓ \"The bundle should be delivered in advance [1].\"\n✓ \"Case summaries must accompany the bundle [2].\"\n✓ \"Medical reports are required in personal injury cases [3].\"\n\nEXAMPLES OF INCORRECT CITATION FORMAT (NEVER USE THESE):\n✗ \"The bundle should include case summaries and draft orders 1, 2, 3.\"\n✗ \"The bundle should include case summaries and draft orders [1, 2, 3].\"\n✗ \"The bundle should include case summaries and draft orders 1, 2, [3].\"\n✗ \"The bundle should include case summaries and draft orders [1], [2], [3].\"\n✗ \"The bundle should include case summaries and draft orders 123.\"\n✗ \"The bundle should include case summaries and draft orders 1. 1.\"\n✗ \"The bundle should include case summaries and draft orders 11.\"\n✗ \"The bundle should include case summaries and draft orders 12.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?\n\nSources:\n\nBenefit_Options-2.pdf: There is a whistleblower policy."}], "props": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini", "deployment": "test-chatgpt"}}], "followup_questions": null, "answer": null}, "session_state": {"conversation_id": 1234}}
