or\n\n(b) the claim under this section be stayed for a period to permit proceedings to be started in the claim in that Protocol and joined to or heard together with the claim under this section.\n\nConduct of the hearing\n\n2.15 Rules 27.8 to 27.11 apply save that any hearing at which the issues under this section are being determined will be an oral hearing attended by both parties or their representatives.\n\n2.16\n\n(1) The court will when determining liability under this section make an order in the following format-\n\n(a) liability found in full against the defendant;\n\n(b) liability found in part against the defendant, specifying the percentage liability of the defendant; or\n\n(c) liability not found against the defendant.\n\n(2) Where the court finds that the defendant was either liable in full or in part and does not reallocate the claim under sub-paragraph (3) below, the court-\n\n(a) will stay the proceedings and direct that the parties use the procedure set out in sections 7, 8 and 9 of the RTA Small Claims Protocolto progress the claim; and\n\n(b) should normally order the defendant to pay the court fee incurred when the claim was started or continued for determination of liability.\n\n(3) The court may give other directions and may reallocate the claim to a different track where it considers that the value of the claim is likely to exceed the limit for the small claims track.\n\nSECTION 3: Assessing the value of the claim: no liability dispute, no claim for non-protocol vehicle costs or uplift request\n\nUse of this section\n\n3.1\n\n(1) This section sets out the procedure to be followed where the claimant wishes the court to assess the value of the claim, where-\n\n(a) the parties have been unable to agree settlement under the RTA Small Claims Protocol;\n\n(b) liability is not in dispute (as to which, see paragraph 3.2 below);\n\n(c) there is no claim brought fornon-protocol vehicle costs; and\n\n(d) there is no application for anupliftin exceptional circumstances pursuant to regulation 3 of the Whiplash Injury Regulations 2021 (referred to in this paragraph as an \"upliftapplication\").\n\n(2) For the purposes of this section, \"liability is not in dispute\" means that either-\n\n(a) there has been anadmission of liability in full;\n\n(b) there has been anadmission of liability in partand the claimant has accepted that part admission; or\n\n(c) liability has already been found against the defendant (either in full or part) by the court in a claim under section 2 of this Practice Direction.",
