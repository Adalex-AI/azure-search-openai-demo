The requirement to submit form N 180 or N 181 as appropriate does not apply if the defendant's response to the claim is to admit the whole of the claim.\n\n(9 B)Omitted\n\n10.1(10)If the defendant does not submit the paper response form to the court on time, the claimant may apply to the court for default judgment and paragraph 11.1 will apply.

SECTION 16 - PROCESS FOR RESUMING A CLAIM THAT HAS BEEN STAYED (\"LIFTING\" A STAY)\n\nProcess for resuming a claim that has been stayed (\"lifting\" a stay)\n\n16.1(1)This Section sets out the process for lifting a stay of proceedings (as defined) so that proceedings on a claim may be resumed. If, however, another provision contains provisions about resuming claims that have been stayed in particular circumstances, that provision prevails to the extent that it is inconsistent with this Section.\n\n(2)If the proceedings have been stayed and all the parties are acting in person, any party may make an application to the court to \"lift\" the stay (as defined) so that the proceedings on the claim can be resumed. (Section 16 B contains provisions about making applications.)\n\n(3)Omitted\n\n(4)If the court receives an application to lift the stay, the court must refer the application to a judge for directions, which may include that the claim be sent out of Online Civil Money Claims.

It will only be appropriate for a legal adviser to consider a request if a provision elsewhere in the Civil Procedure Rules enables them to consider requests of this type.\n\n(7) After an online application has been made and unless the application is to be dealt with without notice, the respondent must provide initial information to assist with managing the future conduct of the application (\"respondent information\") by -\n\n(a) completing the relevant screens on the OCMC website;\n\n(b) submitting the completed screens to the court using the website;\n\n(c) if relevant and requested to do so by the court, confirming whether the respondent consents to the application.\n\n(8) If the respondent confirms that they had consented to the application and that their consent was given before the application was made, the application is to be treated as an application for a consent order and the requirements in rule 40.6(7)(c) and PD 40 B paragraph 3.4(3) are disapplied.\n\n(9) The respondent must provide their respondent information -\n\n(a) before 4 pm on the 5 thday after the date of notification of the online application; or\n\n(b) within such other time limit notified to the respondent at the same time that the respondent is notified of the online application as directed by the Designated Civil Judge Online.\n\n(10) In addition to any applications that are required to be made as on-paper applications under paragraph 7.45, the following applications must also be made as on-paper applications-\n\n(a) any application made before a claim has been issued;\n\n(b) any application for default judgment under paragraph 11.1 B(8) where there is a Mental Health Crisis Moratorium in place under the Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space Moratorium and Mental Health Crisis Moratorium) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020;\n\n(ba) any application for the determination of the amount of costs or disbursements under Civil Procedure Rule 45.64 (determination where all parties agree on all issues except costs);\n\n(c) any application relating to-\n\n(i) an appeal;\n\n(ii) enforcement; or\n\n(iii) insolvency; and\n\n(d) any application where any respondent is not already a party to the claim.\n\nOther applications\n\n16 B.2(1) If a party wishes to make an application that is not an online application or otherwise covered by a provision of this practice direction, the application must be made using the procedure set out in the rest of the Civil Procedure Rules.\n\n(2) Any application made under subparagraph (1) is to be made to the CTSC or, where the parties have received an order from a judge or \"legal adviser\"(as defined) at a County Court hearing centre, or have been informed that the claim is to be managed at a County Court hearing centre, that hearing centre. When the court receives any such application, the application must be considered by a judge or a \"legal adviser\" (as defined), if appropriate, who must give directions as to how the application is to be handled. The directions may include a direction that the claim is to be sent out of Online Civil Money Claims, unless the application is an application for the determination of costs or disbursements under Civil Procedure Rule 45.64, in which the case the directions must include that the claim be sent out of Online Civil Money Claims. SECTION 17 - PROCEDURE WHERE THE PARTIES MAKE A REQUEST TO THE COURT NOT COVERED BY ONLINE CIVIL MONEY CLAIMS\n\nProcedure where the parties make a request to the court not covered by online civil money claims\n\n17.1(1)If the claimant or defendant wants to make a request to the court which is not catered for by this practice direction but is permitted by a provision elsewhere in the Civil Procedure Rules or Practice Directions, or by a court order, that party must notify the CTSC or, where the parties have received an order from a judge or a \"legal adviser\" (as defined) at a County Court hearing centre, or have been informed that the claim is to be managed at a County Court hearing centre, that hearing centre. SECTION 18 - PARTIES OR THE COURT REQUIRING THE CLAIM TO BE SENT OUT OF ONLINE CIVIL MONEY CLAIMS\n\nThe claimant or defendant no longer wishes to take part in the Online Civil Money Claims\n\n18.1 If the claimant or defendant no longer wishes to take part in Online Civil Money Claims, they may request that the court sends the claim out. If the court receives such a request, it must refer the matter to a judge. The judge must then direct that the claim be sent out of the Online Civil Money Claims.\n\nCourt considers that a claim is not - or is no longer - suitable for Online Civil Money Claims\n\n18.2(1)Where a claim has not already been transferred out of Online Civil Money Claims but the court, at any stage, concludes that the claim is not suitable for Online Civil Money Claims, or is no longer suitable for it, or is otherwise not appropriate for it -\n\n(a) the court must transfer the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims, if the reason that the claim is not, or is no longer, suitable or appropriate for the pilot is that a party wishes to take a step in proceedings not catered for by the pilot; or\n\n(b) a judge must transfer the claim out.\n\n(2)When the court transfers a claim out of Online Civil Money Claims under paragraph (1)(a), the court must transfer the claim to the CNBC unless the claim had already been transferred to a County Court hearing centre, in which case the court must transfer the claim out of the pilot to that hearing centre. SECTION 19 - PROCESS FOR SENDING A CLAIM OUT OF ONLINE CIVIL MONEY CLAIMS WHERE NO OTHER PROVISION APPLIES\n\nProcess for sending a claim out of online civil money claims where no other provision applies\n\n19.1(1).If -\n\n(a) a provision of this practice direction requires the court or a judge to send a claim out of Online Civil Money Claims; or\n\n(b) under \"directions\" (as defined) a claim is to be sent out of Online Civil Money Claims, then this Section sets out the process for sending the claim out. If, however, another provision applies to a particular claim and sets out the whole or part of the process for sending out, that provision prevails to the extent that it is inconsistent with this Section.\n\n19.1(2)A judge must decide where to send a claim that is being sent out.\n\n19.1(3)To ensure that a claim is sent out of Online Civil Money Claims successfully, the court may give directions (as defined) about how the claim is to be sent out.The court may also give directions about the future management of the claim. Directions given under this paragraph may include directions changing how any of the Civil Procedure Rules or any of the other practice directions will apply to the claim.\n\n19.1(4)If the court sends a claim out of Online Civil Money Claims, the court must inform the claimant and defendant of this and must -\n\n(a) explain why the claim has been sent out; and\n\n(b) set out any directions given by the court.\n\n19.1(5)Once the court sends the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims, this practice direction will no longer apply to the claim, but the rest of the Civil Procedure Rules and other practice directions will continue to apply, with any changes that the court has directed and with the following modifications: any of the party's form N 180, N 181 or online directions questionnaires is treated as that party's completed directions questionnaire form N 180 or N 181 as appropriate, completed under Civil Procedure Rules Part 26.
