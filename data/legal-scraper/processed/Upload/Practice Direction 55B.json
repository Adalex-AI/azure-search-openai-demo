These may include requiring users of Possession Claims Online -\n\n(1) to enter a customer identification number or password;\n\n(2) to provide personal information for identification purposes; and\n\n(3) to comply with any other security measures,\n\nbefore taking any step online.\n\n---\n\nFees\n\n4.1 A step may only be taken using Possession Claims Online on payment of the prescribed fee where a fee is payable. Where this practice direction provides for a fee to be paid electronically, it may be paid by -\n\n(1) credit card;\n\n(2) debit card; or\n\n(3) any other method which HM Courts and Tribunals Service may permit.\n\n4.2 A defendant who wishes to claim exemption from payment of fees must do so through an organisation approved by HM Courts and Tribunals Service before taking any step using PCOL which attracts a fee. If satisfied that the defendant is entitled to fee exemption, the organisation will submit the fee exemption form through the PCOL website to HM Courts and Tribunals Service. The defendant may then use PCOL to take such a step.\n\n(HM Courts and Tribunals Service website contains guidance as to when the entitlement to claim an exemption from payment of fees arises. The PCOL website will contain a list of organisations through which the defendant may claim an exemption from fees).\n\n---\n\nClaims which may be started using Possession Claims Online\n\n5.1 A claim may be started online if -\n\n(1) it is brought under Sections I or IV of Part 55;\n\n(2) it includes a possession claim for residential property or a Renting Homes possession claim by -\n\n(a) a landlord against a tenant or contract holder, solely on the ground of arrears of rent (but not a claim for forfeiture of a lease); or\n\n(b) a mortgagee against a mortgagor, solely on the ground of default in the payment of sums due under a mortgage,\n\nrelating to land the address for which is served by a County Court hearing centre;\n\n(3) it does not include a claim for any other remedy except for payment of arrears of rent or money due under a mortgage, interest and costs;\n\n(3 A) the claimant has an address for service in the United Kingdom;\n\n(4) the defendant has an address for service in England and Wales; and\n\n(5) the claimant is able to provide a postcode for the property.\n\n5.2 A claim must not be started online if a defendant is known to be a child or protected party.\n\n---\n\nStarting a claim\n\n6.1 A claimant may request the issue of a claim form by-\n\n(1) completing an online claim form at the PCOL website;\n\n(2) paying the appropriate issue fee electronically at the PCOL website or by some other means approved by HM Courts and Tribunals Service.\n\n6.2 The particulars of claim must be included in the online claim form and may not be filed separately.
