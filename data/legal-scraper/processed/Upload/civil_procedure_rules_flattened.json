    "content": "Practice Directions\n\n---\n\n(1.) The practice directions to the Civil Procedure Rules apply to civil litigation in the Queen's Bench Division and the Chancery Division of the High Court and to litigation in the county courts other than family proceedings. Where relevant they also apply to appeals to the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\n(2.) Since the coming into force of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 in April 2006, the power to make practice directions for the civil courts falls to the Lord Chief Justice (with the approval of the Lord Chancellor in most instances). This power is governed by Section 5 of the Civil Procedure Act (as amended).\n\n(3.) The Lord Chief Justice has power under the Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Constitutional Reform Act to nominate a judicial office holder to perform his functions with regards making designated directions. He has therefore nominated the Master of the Rolls to make practice directions for the civil courts.\n\nHistorical Making Powers\n\n(4.) Until the inception of the Constitutional Reform Act, practice directions were made -\n\n(1) for the Queen's Bench Division by the Lord Chief Justice as president of that Division;\n\n(2) for the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal by the Master of the Rolls as president of that Division;\n\n(3) for the Chancery Division by the Vice-Chancellor as vice-president of that Division; and\n\n(4) for the county courts by the Lord Chancellor or a person authorised to act on his behalf under section 74 A of the County Courts Act 1984.\n\n(5.) From April 1999 to July 2000 the Lord Chancellor authorised the Vice-Chancellor, Sir Richard Scott (as he then was) under section 74 A of the 1984 Act. The Vice-Chancellor made all practice directions for county courts during that time.\n\n(6.) From July 2000 to September 2003, the Lord Chancellor authorised Lord Justice May to make these practice directions. Lord Justice May made all practice directions for county courts during that time.\n\n(7.) From September 2003 until April 2006 the Lord Chancellor authorised Lord Justice Dyson to make practice directions for the county courts.",

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 1 A - PARTICIPATION OF VULNERABLE PARTIES OR WITNESSES\n\n---\n\nVulnerability\n\n1.The overriding objective requires that, in order to deal with a case justly, the court should ensure, so far as practicable, that the parties are on an equal footing and can participate fully in proceedings, and that parties and witnesses can give their best evidence. The parties are required to help the court to further the overriding objective at all stages of civil proceedings.\n\n2.Vulnerability of a party or witness may impede participation and also diminish the quality of evidence. The court should take all proportionate measures to address these issues in every case.\n\n3.A person should be considered as vulnerable when a factor - which could be personal or situational, permanent or temporary - may adversely affect their participation in proceedings or the giving of evidence.\n\n4.Factors which may cause vulnerability in a party or witness include (but are not limited to)-\n\n(a) Age, immaturity or lack of understanding;\n\n(b) Communication or language difficulties (including literacy);\n\n(c) Physical disability or impairment, or health condition;\n\n(d) Mental health condition or significant impairment of any aspect of their intelligence or social functioning (including learning difficulties);\n\n(e) The impact on them of the subject matter of, or facts relevant to, the case (an example being having witnessed a traumatic event relating to the case);\n\n(f) Their relationship with a party or witness (examples being sexual assault, domestic abuse or intimidation (actual or perceived));\n\n(g) Social, domestic or cultural circumstances.\n\n5.When considering whether a factor may adversely affect the ability of a party or witness to participate in proceedings and/or give evidence, the court should consider their ability to-\n\n(a) understand the proceedings and their role in them;\n\n(b) express themselves throughout the proceedings;\n\n(c) put their evidence before the court;\n\n(d) respond to or comply with any request of the court, or do so in a timely manner;\n\n(e) instruct their representative/s (if any) before, during and after the hearing; and\n\n(f) attend any hearing.\n\n6.The court, with the assistance of the parties, should try to identify vulnerability of parties or witnesses at the earliest possible stage of proceedings and to consider whether a party's participation in the proceedings, or the quality of evidence given by a party or witness, is likely to be diminished by reason of vulnerability and, if so, whether it is necessary to make directions as a result.\n\n7.If the court decides that a party's or witness's ability to participate fully and/or give best evidence is likely to be diminished by reason of vulnerability, the court may identify the nature of the vulnerability in an order and may order appropriate provisions to be made to further the overriding objective. This may include concealing the address and/or contact details of either party or a witness for appropriate reasons.\n\n8.Subjectto the nature of any vulnerability having been identified and appropriate provisions having been made, the court should consider ordering ground rules before a vulnerable person is to give evidence, to determine what directions are necessary in relation to-\n\n(a) the nature and extent of that evidence;\n\n(b) the conduct of the advocates and/or the parties in respect of the evidence of that person;\n\n(c) whether one or more special measures and/or any other support should be put in place for that person;\n\n(d) any duty or power of the court under any enactment or its inherent jurisdiction to prohibit, limit or modify cross-examination of or by a vulnerable witness or to appoint a legal representative to conduct a cross-examination.\n\n9.Before ordering any ground rules, special measures or other support, the court must consider views expressed by a party or witness about participating in the proceedings or giving evidence\n\nSpecial Measures\n\n10.Special measures may include, but are not limited to:\n\n(a) preventing a party or witness from seeing another party or witness by the use of screens;\n\n(b) allowing a party or witness to give evidence remotely by video conference;\n\n(c) hearing a party or witness's evidence in private;\n\n(d) dispensing with the wearing of wigs and gowns;\n\n(e) admitting pre-recorded video evidence;\n\n(f) questioning a party or witness through an intermediary; and\n\n(g) using a device or other aid to help a party or witness communicate.",

Sanctions for dishonouring cheque\n\n3.7 B\n\n(1) This rule applies where any fee is paid by cheque and that cheque is subsequently dishonoured.\n\n(2) The court will serve a notice on the paying party requiring payment of the fee which will specify the date by which the fee must be paid.\n\n(3) If the fee is not paid by the date specified in the notice -\n\n(a) where the fee is payable by the claimant, the claim will automatically be struck out without further order of the court;\n\n(b) where the fee is payable by the defendant, the defence will automatically be struck out without further order of the court,\n\nand the paying party shall be liable for the costs which any other party has incurred unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(Rule 44.9 provides for the basis of assessment where a right to costs arises under this rule)\n\n(4) If -\n\n(a) the paying party applies to have the claim or defence reinstated; and\n\n(b) the court grants relief,\n\nthe relief shall be conditional on that party paying the fee within the period specified in paragraph (5).\n\n(5) The period referred to in paragraph (4) is -\n\n(a) if the order granting relief is made at a hearing at which the paying party is present or represented, 2 days from the date of the order;\n\n(b) in any other case, 7 days from the date of service of the order on the paying party.\n\n(6) For the purposes of this rule, 'claimant' includes a claimant in a counterclaim or other additional claim and 'claim form' includes a counterclaim or other additional claim. Sanctions have effect unless defaulting party obtains relief\n\n3.8\n\n(1) Where a party has failed to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order, any sanction for failure to comply imposed by the rule, practice direction or court order has effect unless the party in default applies for and obtains relief from the sanction.\n\n(Rule 3.9 sets out the circumstances which the court will consider on an application to grant relief from a sanction)\n\n(2) Where the sanction is the payment of costs, the party in default may only obtain relief by appealing against the order for costs.\n\n(3) Where a rule, practice direction or court order -\n\n(a) requires a party to do something within a specified time, and\n\n(b) specifies the consequence of failure to comply,\n\nthe time for doing the act in question may not be extended by agreement between the parties except as provided in paragraph (4).\n\n(4) In the circumstances referred to in paragraph (3) and unless the court orders otherwise, the time for doing the act in question may be extended by prior written agreement of the parties for up to a maximum of 28 days, provided always that any such extension does not put at risk any hearing date. Relief from sanctions\n\n3.9\n\n(1) On an application for relief from any sanction imposed for a failure to comply with any rule, practice direction or court order, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, so as to enable it to deal justly with the application, including the need -\n\n(a) for litigation to be conducted efficiently and at proportionate cost; and\n\n(b) to enforce compliance with rules, practice directions and orders.\n\n(2) An application for relief must be supported by evidence. General power of the court to rectify matters where there has been an error of procedure\n\n3.10 Where there has been an error of procedure such as a failure to comply with a rule or practice direction -\n\n(a) the error does not invalidate any step taken in the proceedings unless the court so orders; and\n\n(b) the court may make an order to remedy the error. Orders restraining civil proceedings\n\n3.11\n\n(1) A \"civil proceedings order\" and an \"all proceedings order\" under section 42(1 A) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 shall include provision for applying to begin, continue or make any application in any civil proceedings.\n\n(2) A practice direction may set out -\n\n(a) the circumstances in which the court has the power to make a civil restraint order against a party to proceedings;\n\n(b) the procedure where a party applies for a civil restraint order against another party; and\n\n(c) the consequences of the court making a civil restraint order. II COSTS MANAGEMENT Application of this Section and the purpose of costs management\n\n3.12\n\n(1) This Section and Practice Direction 3 D apply to all Part 7 multi-track cases, except-\n\n(a) where the claim is commenced on or after 22 nd April 2014 and the amount of money claimed as stated on the claim form is £10 million or more; or\n\n(b) where the claim is commenced on or after 22 nd April 2014 and is for a monetary claim which is not quantified or not fully quantified or is for a non-monetary claim and in any such case the claim form contains a statement that the claim is valued at £10 million or more; or\n\n(c) where in proceedings commenced on or after 6 th April 2016 a claim is made by or on behalf of a person under the age of 18 (a child) (and on a child reaching majority this exception will continue to apply unless the court otherwise orders); or(d) where the proceeding are the subject of fixed costs or scale costs; or(e) the court otherwise orders.\n\n(1 A) This Section and Practice Direction 3 D will apply to any other proceedings (including applications) where the court so orders.\n\n(2) The purpose of costs management is that the court should manage both the steps to be taken and the costs to be incurred by the parties to any proceedings (or variation costs as provided in rule 3.15 A) so as to further the overriding objective. Filing and exchanging budgets and budget discussion reports\n\n3.13\n\n(1) Unless the court otherwise orders, all parties except litigants in person must file and exchange budgets-\n\n(a) where the stated value of the claim on the claim form is less than £50,000, with their directions questionnaires; or\n\n(b) in any other case, not later than 21 days before the first case management conference.\n\n(2) In the event that a party files and exchanges a budget under paragraph (1), all other parties, not being litigants in person, must file an agreed budget discussion report no later than 7 days before the first case management conference.\n\n(3) The court-\n\n(a) may, on its own initiative or on application, order the parties to file and exchange costs budgets in a case where the parties are not otherwise required by this Section to do so;\n\n(b) shall (other than in an exceptional case) make an order to file and exchange costs budgets if all parties consent to an application for such an order.\n\n(4) The court may, in a substantial case, direct that budgets are to be limited in the first instance to part only of the proceedings and extended later to cover the whole proceedings.\n\n(5) Every budget must be dated and verified by a statement of truth signed by a senior legal representative of the party.\n\n(6) Even though a litigant in person is not required to prepare a budget, each other party (other than a litigant in person) must provide the litigant in person with a copy of that party's budget. Failure to file a budget\n\n3.14 Unless the court otherwise orders, any party which fails to file a budget despite being required to do so will be treated as having filed a budget comprising only the applicable court fees. Costs management orders\n\n3.15\n\n(1) In addition to exercising its other powers, the court may manage the costs to be incurred (the budgeted costs) by any party in any proceedings.\n\n(2) The court may at any time make a 'costs management order'. Where costs budgets have been filed and exchanged the court will make a costs management order unless it is satisfied that the litigation can be conducted justly and at proportionate cost in accordance with the overriding objective without such an order being made. By a costs management order the court will-\n\n(a) record the extent to which the budgeted costs are agreed between the parties;\n\n(b) in respect of the budgeted costs which are not agreed, record the court's approval after making appropriate revisions;\n\n(c) record the extent (if any) to which incurred costs are agreed.\n\n(3) If a costs management order has been made, the court will thereafter control the parties' budgets in respect of recoverable costs.\n\n(4) Whether or not the court makes a costs management order, it may record on the face of any case management order any comments it has about the incurred costs which are to be taken into account in any subsequent assessment proceedings.\n\n(5) Save in exceptional circumstances-\n\n(a )the recoverable costs of initially completing Precedent H (the form to be used for a costs budget) shall not exceed the higher of-\n\n(i) £1,000; or\n\n(ii) 1% of the total of the incurred costs (as agreed or allowed on assessment) and the budgeted costs (agreed or approved); and\n\n(b) all other recoverable costs of the budgeting and costs management process shall not exceed 2% of the total of the incurred costs (as agreed or allowed on assessment) and the budgeted (agreed or approved) costs.\n\n(Precedent H is annexed to Practice Direction 3 D.)\n\n(6) The court may set a timetable or give other directions for future reviews of budgets.\n\n(7) After a party's budgeted costs have been approved or agreed, the party must re-file and re-serve the budget-\n\n(a) in the form approved or agreed with re-cast figures; and\n\n(b) annexed to the order approving the budgeted costs or recording the parties' agreement.\n\n(8) A costs management order concerns the totals allowed for each phase of the budget, and while the underlying detail in the budget for each phase used by the party to calculate the totals claimed is provided for reference purposes to assist the court in fixing a budget, it is not the role of the court in the costs management hearing to fix or approve the hourly rates claimed in the budget. Revision and variation of costs budgets on account of significant developments (\"variation costs\")\n\n3.15 A.\n\n(1) A party (\"the revising party\") must revise its budgeted costs upwards or downwards if significant developments in the litigation warrant such revisions.\n\n(2) Any budgets revised in accordance with paragraph (1) must be submitted promptly by the revising party to the other parties for agreement, and subsequently to the court, in accordance with paragraphs (3) to (5).\n\n(3) The revising party must-\n\n(a) serve particulars of the variation proposed on every other party, using the form prescribed by Practice Direction 3 D;\n\n(b) confine the particulars to the additional costs occasioned by the significant development; and\n\n(c) certify, in the form prescribed by Practice Direction 3 D, that the additional costs are not included in any previous budgeted costs or variation.\n\n(4) The revising party must submit the particulars of variation promptly to the court, together with the last approved or agreed budget, and with an explanation of the points of difference if they have not been agreed.\n\n(5) The court may approve, vary or disallow the proposed variations, having regard to any significant developments which have occurred since the date when the previous budget was approved or agreed, or may list a further costs management hearing.\n\n(6) Where the court makes an order for variation, it may vary the budget for costs related to that variation which have been incurred prior to the order for variation but after the costs management order. Costs management conferences\n\n3.16\n\n(1) Any hearing which is convened solely for the purpose of costs management (for example, to approve a revised budget) is referred to as a 'costs management conference'.\n\n(2) Where practicable, costs management conferences should be conducted by telephone or in writing. Court to have regard to budgets and to take account of costs\n\n3.17\n\n(1) When making any case management decision, the court will have regard to any available budgets of the parties and will take into account the costs involved in each procedural step.\n\n(2) Paragraph (1) applies whether or not the court has made a costs management order.\n\n(3) Subject to rule 3.15 A, the court-\n\n(a) may not approve costs incurred up to and including the date of any costs management hearing; but\n\n(b) may record its comments on those costs and take those costs into account when considering the reasonableness and proportionality of all budgeted costs.\n\n(4) If an interim application is made but is not included in a budget, the court may, if it considers it reasonable not to have included the application in the budget, treat the costs of such interim application as additional to the approved budgets. Assessing costs on the standard basis where a costs management order has been made\n\n3.18 In any case where a costs management order has been made, when assessing costs on the standard basis, the court will -\n\n(a) have regard to the receiving party's last approved or agreed budgeted costs for each phase of the proceedings;\n\n(b) not depart from such approved or agreed budgeted costs unless satisfied that there is good reason to do so; and\n\n(c) take into account any comments made pursuant to rule 3.17(3) and recorded on the face of the order.\n\n(Attention is drawn to rules 44.3(2)(a) and 44.3(5), which concern proportionality of costs.) III COSTS CAPPING Costs capping orders - General\n\n3.19\n\n(1) For the purposes of this Section-\n\n(a) 'costs capping order' means an order limiting the amount of future costs (including disbursements) which a party may recover pursuant to an order for costs subsequently made; and\n\n(b) 'future costs' means costs incurred in respect of work done after the date of the costs capping order but excluding the amount of any additional liability.(2) This Section does not apply to judicial review costs capping orders under Part 4 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 or to protective costs orders.(Rules 46.16 to 46.19 make provision for judicial review costs capping orders under Part 4 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015.)\n\n(3) Omitted.\n\n(4) A costs capping order may be in respect of -\n\n(a) the whole litigation; or\n\n(b) any issues which are ordered to be tried separately.\n\n(5) The court may at any stage of proceedings make a costs capping order against all or any of the parties, if -\n\n(a) it is in the interests of justice to do so;\n\n(b) there is a substantial risk that without such an order costs will be disproportionately incurred; and\n\n(c) it is not satisfied that the risk in subparagraph (b) can be adequately controlled by -\n\n(i) case management directions or orders made under this Part; and\n\n(ii) detailed assessment of costs.\n\n(6) In considering whether to exercise its discretion under this rule, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, including -\n\n(a) whether there is a substantial imbalance between the financial position of the parties;\n\n(b) whether the costs of determining the amount of the cap are likely to be proportionate to the overall costs of the litigation;\n\n(c) the stage which the proceedings have reached; and\n\n(d) the costs which have been incurred to date and the future costs.\n\n(7) A costs capping order, once made, will limit the costs recoverable by the party subject to the order unless a party successfully applies to vary the order. No such variation will be made unless -\n\n(a) there has been a material and substantial change of circumstances since the date when the order was made; or\n\n(b) there is some other compelling reason why a variation should be made. Application for a costs capping order\n\n3.20\n\n(1) An application for a costs capping order must be made on notice in accordance with Part 23.\n\n(2) The application notice must -\n\n(a) set out -\n\n(i) whether the costs capping order is in respect of the whole of the litigation or a particular issue which is ordered to be tried separately; and\n\n(ii) why a costs capping order should be made; and\n\n(b) be accompanied by a budget setting out -\n\n(i) the costs (and disbursements) incurred by the applicant to date; and\n\n(ii) the costs (and disbursements) which the applicant is likely to incur in the future conduct of the proceedings.\n\n(3) The court may give directions for the determination of the application and such directions may -\n\n(a) direct any party to the proceedings -\n\n(i) to file a schedule of costs in the form set out in paragraph 3 of Practice Direction 3 E - Costs capping;\n\n(ii) to file written submissions on all or any part of the issues arising;\n\n(b) fix the date and time estimate of the hearing of the application;\n\n(c) indicate whether the judge hearing the application will sit with an assessor at the hearing of the application; and\n\n(d) include any further directions as the court sees fit. Application to vary a costs capping order\n\n3.21 An application to vary a costs capping order must be made by application notice pursuant to Part 23.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. 2007 c.29.",

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 3 A - STRIKING OUT A STATEMENT OF CASE\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Rule 3.4\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nIntroductory\n\n1.1 This practice direction sets out the procedure a party should follow if they wish to make an application for an order under rule 3.4(2)(a) (where a statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending a claim); or under rule 3.4(2)(b) (where a statement of case is an abuse of the court's process or otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings).\n\n1.2 The following are examples of cases where the court may conclude that particulars of claim (whether contained in a claim form or filed separately) fall within rule 3.4(2)(a):(1) those which set out no facts indicating what the claim is about, for example 'Money owed £5000',(2) those which are incoherent and make no sense,(3) those which contain a coherent set of facts but those facts, even if true, do not disclose any legally recognisable claim against the defendant.\n\n1.3 A claim may fall within rule 3.4(2)(b) where it is vexatious, scurrilous or obviously ill-founded.\n\n1.4 A defence may fall within rule 3.4(2)(a) where:(1) it consists of a bare denial or otherwise sets out no coherent statement of facts, or(2) the facts it sets out, while coherent, would not amount in law to a defence to the claim even if true.\n\n1.5 A party may believe they can show without a trial that an opponent's case has no real prospect of success on the facts, or that the case is bound to succeed or fail, as the case may be, because of a point of law (including the interpretation of a document). In such a case the party concerned may make an application under rule 3.4 or apply for summary judgment under Part 24 (or both) as they think appropriate.\n\n1.6 Where a rule, practice direction or order states 'shall be struck out or dismissed' or 'will be struck out or dismissed' this means that the striking out or dismissal will be automatic and that no further order of the court is required.\n\n---\n\nClaims which appear to fall within rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b)\n\n2.1 If a court officer is asked to issue a claim form which they believe may fall within rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b) they should issue it, but may then consult a judge (under rule 3.2) before returning the claim form to the claimant or taking any other step to serve the defendant. The judge may on they own initiative make an immediate order designed to ensure that the claim is disposed of or proceeds in a way that accords with the rules.\n\n2.2 The judge may allow the claimant a hearing before deciding whether to make such an order.\n\n2.3 Orders the judge may make include:(1) an order that the claim be stayed until further order,(2) an order that the claim form be retained by the court and not served until the stay is lifted,(3) an order that no application by the claimant to lift the stay be heard unless they file such further documents (for example a witness statement or an amended claim form or particulars of claim) as may be specified in the order.\n\n2.4 Where the judge makes any such order or, subsequently, an order lifting the stay they may give directions about the service on the defendant of the order and any other documents on the court file.\n\n2.5 The fact that a judge allows a claim referred to them by a court officer to proceed does not prejudice the right of any party to apply for any order against the claimant.\n\n---\n\nDefences which appear to fall within rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b)\n\n3.1 A court officer may similarly consult a judge about any document filed which purports to be a defence and which he believes may fall within rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b).\n\n3.2 If the judge decides that the document falls within rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b) they may on their own initiative make an order striking it out. Where they do so they may extend the time for the defendant to file a proper defence.\n\n3.3 The judge may allow the defendant a hearing before deciding whether to make such an order.\n\n3.4 Alternatively the judge may make an order under rule 18.1 requiring the defendant within a stated time to clarify his defence or to give additional information about it. The order may provide that the defence will be struck out if the defendant does not comply.\n\n3.5 The fact that a judge does not strike out a defence on their own initiative does not prejudice the right of the claimant to apply for any order against the defendant.\n\n---\n\nGeneral provisions\n\n4.1 The court may exercise its powers under rule 3.4(2)(a) or (b) on application or on its own initiative at any time.\n\n4.2 Where a judge at a hearing strikes out all or part of a party's statement of case he may enter such judgment for the other party as that party appears entitled to.\n\n---\n\nApplications for orders under rule 3.4(2)\n\n5.1 Attention is drawn to Part 23 (General Rules about Applications) and to Practice Direction 23 A. The practice direction requires all applications to be made as soon as possible and before allocation if possible.\n\n5.2 While many applications under rule 3.4(2) can be made without evidence in support, the applicant should consider whether facts need to be proved and, if so, whether evidence in support should be filed and served.\n\n---\n\nApplications for summary judgment\n\n6.1 Applications for summary judgment may be made under Part 24.

Rule 52.20(6) makes similar provision where the appeal court refuses an application for permission to appeal, strikes out an appellant's notice or dismisses an appeal.\n\n---\n\nLimited civil restraint orders\n\n2.1 A limited civil restraint order may be made by a judge of any court where a party has made 2 or more applications which are totally without merit.\n\n2.2 Where the court makes a limited civil restraint order, the party against whom the order is made -\n\n(1) will be restrained from making any further applications in the proceedings in which the order is made without first obtaining the permission of a judge identified in the order;\n\n(2) may apply for amendment or discharge of the order provided he has first obtained the permission of a judge identified in the order; and\n\n(3) may apply for permission to appeal the order and if permission is granted, may appeal the order.\n\n2.3 Where a party who is subject to a limited civil restraint order -\n\n(1) makes a further application in the proceedings in which the order is made without first obtaining the permission of a judge identified in the order, such application will automatically be dismissed -\n\n(a) without the judge having to make any further order; and\n\n(b) without the need for the other party to respond to it;\n\n(2) repeatedly makes applications for permission pursuant to that order which are totally without merit, the court may direct that if the party makes any further application for permission which is totally without merit, the decision to dismiss the application will be final and there will be no right of appeal, unless the judge who refused permission grants permission to appeal.\n\n2.4 A party who is subject to a limited civil restraint order may not make an application for permission under paragraphs 2.2(1) or 2.2(2) without first serving notice of the application on the other party in accordance with paragraph 2.5.\n\n2.5 A notice under paragraph 2.4 must -\n\n(1) set out the nature and grounds of the application;

or\n\n(3) a Designated Civil Judge or their appointed deputy in the County Court,where a party has persistently issued claims or made applications which are totally without merit.\n\n3.2 Unless the court otherwise orders, where the court makes an extended civil restraint order, the party against whom the order is made -\n\n(1) will be restrained from issuing claims or making applications in -\n\n(a) any court if the order has been made by a judge of the Court of Appeal;\n\n(b) the High Court or the County Court if the order has been made by a judge of the High Court; or\n\n(c) the County Court if the order has been made by a designated civil judge or their appointed deputy, concerning any matter involving or relating to or touching upon or leading to the proceedings in which the order is made without first obtaining the permission of a judge identified in the order;\n\n(2) may apply for amendment or discharge of the order provided he has first obtained the permission of a judge identified in the order;

and\n\n(3) must identify the judge or judges to whom an application for permission under paragraphs 4.2(1), 4.2(2) or 4.8 should be made.\n\n4.10 The court may extend the duration of a general civil restraint order, if it considers it appropriate to do so, but it must not be extended for a period greater than 3 years on any given occasion.\n\n4.11 If they consider that it would be appropriate to make a general civil restraint order -\n\n(1) a Master or a District Judge in a district registry of the High Court must transfer the proceedings to a High Court judge;

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 3 D - COSTS MANAGEMENT\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements Part 3\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nA. Production of Costs Budgets\n\n1.In cases where the Claimant has a limited or severely impaired life expectation (5 years or less remaining) the court will ordinarily disapply cost management under Section II of Part 3.\n\n2.An order for the provision of costs budgets with a view to a costs management order being made may be particularly appropriate in the following cases-\n\n(a) unfair prejudice petitions under section 994 of the Companies Act 2006;\n\n(b) disqualification proceedings pursuant to the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986;\n\n(c) applications under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996;\n\n(d) claims pursuant to the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975;\n\n(e) any Part 8 or other claims or applications involving a substantial dispute of fact and/or likely to require oral evidence and/or extensive disclosure; and\n\n(f) personal injury and clinical negligence cases where the value of the claim is £10 million or more.\n\n---\n\nB. Documents to be lodged for costs budgeting purposes\n\n3.(a)Save in exceptional circumstances or where the court orders otherwise, the parties are not expected to lodge any documents other than Precedent H and the budget discussion report. Both are annexed, to this practice direction. If the Excel format precedent on the MOJ website is used, the calculation on page one will calculate the totals automatically and the phase totals are linked to this page also.\n\n(b) Precedent T, also annexed to this practice direction, is to be used in the event of variation of a budget pursuant to rule 3.15 A.\n\n---\n\nC. Budget format\n\n4.(a) Unless the court otherwise orders, a budget must be in the form of Precedent H annexed to this Practice Direction. It must be in landscape format with an easily legible typeface.\n\n(b) In cases where a party's total costs (incurred and estimated) do not exceed £25,000 or the value of the claim as stated on the claim form is less than £50,000, the parties must only use the first page of Precedent H.\n\n(The wording for a statement of truth verifying a budget is set out in Practice Direction 22.)\n\n5.In deciding the reasonable and proportionate costs of each phase of the budget the court will have regard to the factors set out at Civil Procedure Rules 44.3(5) and 44.4(3) including a consideration of where and the circumstances in which the work was done as opposed to where the case is heard.\n\n6.The table below identifies where within the budget form the various items of work, in so far as they are required by the circumstances of your case, should be included. The time estimated may have to be justified on the budget hearing along with the grade of fee earner doing the work.\n\n7.Allowance must be made in each phase for advising the client, taking instructions and corresponding with the other party/parties and the court in respect of matters falling within that phase.\n\n8.The time spent in preparing the budget and associated material mustnotbe claimed in the draft budget under any phase. The maximum figures permitted under rule 3.15(5) should be inserted once the costs budget has been approved by the court.\n\n9.The 'contingent cost' sections of this form should be used for anticipated costs which do not fall within the main categories set out in this form. Examples might be the trial of preliminary issues, applications to amend, applications for disclosure against third parties or (in libel cases) applications re meaning. Costs which are disputed (such as the need for a particular expert) should be set out in the appropriate phase of the budget and if necessary marked as disputed. Only costs which are more likely than not to be incurred should be included.\n\n(Variation of an approved or agreed budget is dealt with in rule 3.15 A.)\n\n---\n\nD. Assumptions\n\n10.(a) The assumptions that are reflected in the table below are not to be repeated. Include only those assumptions that significantly impact on the level of costs claimed such as the duration of the proceedings, the number of experts and witnesses or the number of interim applications envisaged. Brief details only are required in the box beneath each phase. Additional documents should only be prepared in exceptional circumstance and, where they are disregarded by the court, the cost of preparation may be disallowed.\n\n(b) Written assumptions are not normally required by the Court in cases where the parties are only required to lodge the first page.\n\nPhase\n\nIncludes\n\nDoes NOT include\n\nPre-action\n\n• Pre-Action Protocol correspondence\n• Investigating the merits of the claim and advising client\n• Settlement discussions, advising on settlement and Part 36 offers\n• All other steps taken and advice given pre action\n\n• Any work already incurred in relation to any other phase of the budget\n\nIssue/statements of case\n\n• Preparation of Claim Form\n• Issue and service of proceedings\n• Preparation of Particulars of Claim, Defence, Reply, including taking instructions, instructing counsel and any necessary investigation\n• Considering opposing statements of case and advising client\n• Part 18 requests (request and answer)\n• Any conferences with counsel primarily relating to statements of case\n• Updating schedules and counter schedules of loss\n• Amendments to statements of case\n\nCMC\n\n• Completion of DQs\n• Arranging a CMC\n• Reviewing opponent's budget\n• Correspondence with opponent to agree directions and budgets, where possible\n• Preparation for, and attendance at, the CMC\n• Finalising the order\n• Any further CMC that is built into the proposed directions order\n\n• Preparation of costs budget for first CMC\n\nDisclosure\n\n• Obtaining documents from client and advising on disclosure obligations\n• Reviewing documents for disclosure, preparing disclosure report or questionnaire response and list\n• Inspection\n• Reviewing opponent's list and documents, undertaking any appropriate investigations\n• Correspondence between parties about the scope of disclosure and queries arising\n• Consulting counsel, so far as appropriate, in relation to disclosure\n\n• Applications for specific disclosure\n• Applications and requests for non-party disclosure\n\nWitness\n\nStatements\n\n• Identifying witnesses\n• Obtaining statements\n• Preparing witness summaries\n• Consulting counsel, so far as appropriate, about witness statements\n• Reviewing opponent's statements and undertaking any appropriate investigations\n• Applications for witness summaries\n\n• Arranging for witnesses to attend trial (include in trial preparation)\n\nExpert Reports\n\n• Identifying and engaging suitable expert(s)\n• Reviewing draft and approving report(s)\n• Dealing with follow-up questions of experts\n• Considering opposing experts' reports\n• Any conferences with counsel primarily relating to expert evidence\n• Meetings of experts (preparing agenda etc.)\n\n• Obtaining permission to adduce expert evidence (include in CMC or a separate application)\n• Arranging for experts to attend trial (include in trial preparation)\n\nPTR\n\n• Bundle\n• Preparing and agreeing chronology, case summary and dramatis personae (if ordered and not already prepared earlier in case)\n• Completing and filing pre-trial checklists\n• Correspondence with opponent to agree directions\n• Preparation for and attendance at the PTR\n\n• Assembling and/or copying the bundle (this is not fee earners' work)\n\nTrial\n\nPreparation\n\n• Trial bundles\n• Witness summonses, and arranging\n• for witnesses to attend trial Any final factual investigations Supplemental disclosure and statements (if required)\n• Counsel's brief fee\n• Agreeing brief fee\n• Any pre-trial conferences and advice from counsel\n• Pre-trial liaison with witnesses\n\n• Assembling and/or copying the trial bundle (this is not fee earners' work)\n• Counsel's refreshers\n\nTrial\n\n• Solicitors' attendance at trial\n• All conferences and other activity outside court hours during the trial Attendance on witnesses during the trial\n• Counsel's trial refreshers\n• Dealing with draft judgment and\n• related applications\n\n• Preparation for trial\n• Counsel's brief fee for trial (include in trial preparation)\n\nADR/Settlement\n\n• Any conferences and advice from counsel in relation to settlement\n• Work directed to settlement negotiations and meetings between the parties and any other ADR (including mediation), to include Part 36 and other offers and advising the client\n• Approval of settlement if needed\n• Drafting settlement agreement or Tomlin order\n• Advice to the client on settlement (excluding advice included in the pre action phase)\n\n---\n\nE.

    "id": "Practice Direction 3F – Requests for the Appointment of an Advocate to the Court",
    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 3 F - REQUESTS FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ADVOCATE TO THE COURT\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR, rule 3.1\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.The following provisions are taken from a memorandum agreed between the Attorney General and the Lord Chief Justice dated 19 December 2001. They give guidance about making a request for the appointment of an Advocate to the Court (formerly called an \"amicus curiae\").\n\n2.In most cases, an Advocate to the Court is appointed by the Attorney General, following a request by the court. In some cases, an Advocate to the Court will be appointed by the Official Solicitor or the Children & Family Court Advisory Service (CAFCASS) (see paragraphs 11 and 12 below).\n\n---\n\nThe role of an Advocate to the Court\n\n3.A court may properly seek the assistance of an Advocate to the Court when there is a danger of an important and difficult point of law being decided without the court hearing relevant argument. In those circumstances the Attorney General may decide to appoint an Advocate to the Court.\n\n4.It is important to bear in mind that an Advocate to the Court represents no-one. Their function is to give to the court such assistance as they are able on the relevant law and its application to the facts of the case. An Advocate to the Court will not normally be instructed to lead evidence, cross-examine witnesses, or investigate the facts. In particular, it is not appropriate for the court to seek assistance from an Advocate to the Court simply because a defendant in criminal proceedings refuses representation.\n\n5.The following circumstances are to be distinguished from those where it will be appropriate for the court to seek the assistance of an Advocate to the Court-\n\n(a)where a point of law which affects a government department is being argued in a case where the department is not represented and where the court believe that the department may wish to be represented;\n\n(b)where the Attorney believes it is necessary for them to intervene as a party in the Attorney's capacity as guardian of the public interest;\n\n(c)where the court believes it is appropriate for a litigant in person to seek free (pro bono) assistance;\n\n(d)where, in a criminal trial, the defendant is unrepresented and the Advocate to the Court would be duplicating the prosecutor's duty as a minister of justice \"to assist the court on all matters of law applicable to the case\";\n\n(e)where in a criminal case in relation to sentencing appeals there are issues of fact which are likely to arise and the prosecution ought to be represented, or it would be reasonable to ask the prosecutor to be present and address the court as to the relevant law.\n\n6.In the first of these five cases, the court may invite the Attorney to make arrangements for the advocate to be instructed on behalf of the department. In the second, the court may grant the Attorney permission to intervene, in which case the advocate instructed represents the Attorney. In neither case is the advocate an Advocate to the Court.\n\n7.In the third case the court may grant a litigant in person an adjournment to enable them to seek free (pro bono) assistance. In doing so, the court should bear in mind that it is likely to take longer to obtain free (pro bono) representation than funded representation. In contrast to an Advocate to the Court, a free (pro bono) legal representative will obtain their instructions from the litigant and will represent the interests of that party. Their role before the court and duty to the court will be identical to that of any other representative of the parties. Accordingly, it will not be appropriate for the court to take such a course where the type of assistance required is that provided by an Advocate to the Court.\n\n8.In the fourth case the prosecutor's special duty is akin to an Advocate to the Court. In the fifth case, in relation to appeals against sentence where the defendant is represented, it may be preferable to request the attendance of the prosecutor who will be able to address the court on issues of fact and law. It would not be proper for an Advocate to the Court to take instructions from the prosecuting authority in relation to factual matters relating to the prosecution. An Advocate to the Court should only be asked to address the court as to the relevant law.\n\n---\n\nMaking a request to the Attorney General\n\n9.A request for an Advocate to the Court should be made by the Court as soon as convenient after it is made aware of the point of law which requires the assistance of an Advocate to the Court. The request should set out the circumstances which have occurred, identifying the point of law upon which assistance is sought and the nature of the assistance required. The court should consider whether it would be sufficient for such assistance to be in writing in the form of submissions as to the law, or whether the assistance should include oral submissions at the hearing. The request should ordinarily be made in writing and be accompanied by the papers necessary to enable the Attorney to reach a decision on the basis of a proper understanding of the case.\n\n10.The Attorney will decide whether it is appropriate to provide such assistance and, if so, the form such assistance should take. Before reaching a decision, the Attorney may seek further information or assistance from the court. The Attorney will also ask the court to keep under review the need for such assistance. Where the circumstances which gave rise to the original request have changed, such that the court may now anticipate hearing all relevant argument on the point of law without the presence of an Advocate to the Court, either the Court or the Attorney may ask the Advocate to the Court to withdraw.\n\n---\n\nRequests to the Official Solicitor or CAFCASS\n\n11.A request for an Advocate to the Court may be made to the Official Solicitor or CAFCASS (Legal Services and Special Casework) where the issue is one in which their experience of representing children and adults under disability gives rise to special experience. The division of responsibility between them is outlined in Practice Notes reported at [2001] 2 FLR 151 and [2001] 2 FLR 155.\n\n12.The procedure and circumstances for requesting an Advocate to the Court to be appointed by the Official Solicitor or CAFCASS are the same as those applying to requests to the Attorney General. In cases of extreme urgency, telephone requests may be made. In some cases, the Official Solicitor will be appointed as Advocate to the Court. The Official Solicitor may be given directions by the Court authorising the Official Solicitor to obtain documents, conduct investigations and enquiries and to advise the Court. The Official Solicitor may appear by counsel or an in-house advocate.\n\nRequests for an Advocate to the Court should be addressed as follows-\n\nThe Legal Secretary,The Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers,Attorney General's Office,5-8 The Sanctuary,London SW 1 P 3 JS\n\nTelephone: 020 7271 2492\n\nOffice of the Official Solicitor to the Senior Courts,Victory House, 30-34 Kingsway,London WC 2 B 6 EX\n\nTelephone: 020 3681 2600\n\nFax: 020 3681 2762\n\nE-mail:enquiries@offsol.gsi.gov.uk\n\nCAFCASS (Legal Services and Special Casework) 3 rd Floor,21 Bloomsbury Street,London, WC 1 B 3 HF\n\nTelephone: 0175 323 5272\n\nFor information about free (pro bono) services contact:\n\nBar Pro Bono Unit,48 Chancery Lane,London WC 2 A 1 JF\n\nTelephone: 020 7092 3960.",

Before giving a direction the Master or District Judge may require to be satisfied that the request is made in good faith and that the document is required to be produced for the reasons stated.

It shall be the duty of the court officer who has signed the certificate referred to in para 5.6(8)(b) below to ensure that the document is returned within a reasonable time and to make inquiries and report to the Master or District Judge who has given the direction under paragraph (3) above if the document is not returned, so that steps may be taken to secure its return.\n\n(7) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, the Master or District Judge may direct a court officer to attend the Court, Tribunal or arbitrator for the purpose of producing the document.\n\n(8)\n\n(a) I, of , an officer of the Court/Tribunal at /an arbitrator of /the Claimant /Defendant /Solicitor for the Claimant/ Defendant [describing the Applicant so as to show that he is a proper person to make the request] in the case of v.

Procedure where service is to be through foreign governments, judicial authorities and British Consular authorities\n\n6.43\n\n(1) This rule applies where a party wishes to serve a claim form or any other document under rule 6.42(1) or 6.42(2).\n\n(2) Where this rule applies, that party must file -\n\n(a) a request for service of the claim form or other document specifying one or more of the methods in rule 6.42(1) or 6.42(2);\n\n(b) a copy of the claim form or other document;\n\n(c) any other documents or copies of documents required by Practice Direction 6 B; and\n\n(d) any translation required under rule 6.45.\n\n(3) Where a party files the documents specified in paragraph (2), the court officer will -\n\n(a) seal(GL) the copy of the claim form or other document; and\n\n(b) forward the documents to the Senior Master.\n\n(4) The Senior Master will send documents forwarded under this rule -\n\n(a) where the claim form or other document is being served through the authority designated under the Hague Convention or any other Civil Procedure Convention or Treaty, to that authority; or\n\n(b) in any other case, to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with a request that it arranges for the claim form or other document to be served.\n\n(5) An official certificate which -\n\n(a) states that the method requested under paragraph (2)(a) has been performed and the date of such performance;\n\n(b) states, where more than one method is requested under paragraph (2)(a), which method was used; and\n\n(c) is made by -\n\n(i) a British Consular authority in the country where the method requested under paragraph (2)(a) was performed;\n\n(ii) the government or judicial authorities in that country; or\n\n(iii) the authority designated in respect of that country under the a Civil Procedure Convention or Treaty,is evidence of the facts stated in the certificate.\n\n(6) A document purporting to be an official certificate under paragraph (5) is to be treated as such a certificate, unless it is proved not to be. Service of claim form or other document on a State\n\n6.44\n\n(1) This rule applies where a party wishes to serve the claim form or other document on a State.\n\n(2) In this rule, 'State' has the meaning given by section 14 of the State Immunity Act 197816.\n\n(3) The party must file in the Central Office of the Royal Courts of Justice -\n\n(a) a request for service to be arranged by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office;\n\n(b) a copy of the claim form or other document; and\n\n(c) any translation required under rule 6.45.\n\n(4) The Senior Master will send the documents filed under this rule to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with a request that it arranges for them to be served.\n\n(5) An official certificate by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office stating that a claim form or other document has been duly served on a specified date in accordance with a request made under this rule is evidence of that fact.\n\n(6) A document purporting to be such a certificate is to be treated as such a certificate, unless it is proved not to be.\n\n(7) Where -\n\n(a) section 12(6) of the State Immunity Act 1978 applies; and\n\n(b) the State has agreed to a method of service other than through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,the claim form or other document may be served either by the method agreed or in accordance with this rule.\n\n(Section 12(6) of the State Immunity Act 1978 provides that section 12(1) enables the service of a claim form or other document in a manner to which the State has agreed.) Translation of claim form or other document\n\n6.45\n\n(1) Except where paragraph (4) or (5) applies, every copy of the claim form or other document filed under rule 6.43 (service through foreign governments, judicial authorities etc.) or 6.44 (service of claim form or other document on a State) must be accompanied by a translation of the claim form or other document.\n\n(2) The translation must be -\n\n(a) in the official language of the country in which it is to be served; or\n\n(b) if there is more than one official language of that country, in any official language which is appropriate to the place in the country where the claim form or other document is to be served.\n\n(3) Every translation filed under this rule must be accompanied by a statement by the person making it that it is a correct translation, and the statement must include that person's name, address and qualifications for making the translation.\n\n(4) A party is not required to file a translation of a claim form or other document filed under rule 6.43 (service through foreign governments, judicial authorities etc.) where the claim form or other document is to be served -\n\n(a) in a country of which English is an official language; or\n\n(b) on a British citizen (within the meaning of the British Nationality Act 198117),unless a Civil Procedure Convention or Treaty requires a translation.\n\n(5) A party is not required to file a translation of a claim form or other document filed under rule 6.44 (service of claim form or other document on a State) where English is an official language of the State in which the claim form or other document is to be served.

Proof of service before obtaining judgment\n\n6.47 Where\n\n(a) a hearing is fixed when the claim form is issued;\n\n(b) the claim form is served on a defendant out of the jurisdiction; and\n\n(c) that defendant does not appear at the hearing,\n\nthe claimant may not obtain judgment against the defendant until the claimant files written evidence that the claim form has been duly served in accordance with this Part.\n\nV SERVICE OF DOCUMENTS FROM FOREIGN COURTS OR TRIBUNALS Scope of this Section\n\n6.48 This Section -\n\n(a) applies to the service in England and Wales of any document in connection with civil or commercial proceedings in a foreign court or tribunal Interpretation\n\n6.49 In this Section -\n\n(a) 'convention country' means a country in relation to which there is a Civil Procedure Convention (which has the same meaning as in rule 6.31(c));\n\n(b) 'foreign court or tribunal' means a court or tribunal in a country outside of the United Kingdom; and\n\n(c) 'process server' means -\n\n(i) a process server appointed by the Lord Chancellor to serve documents to which this Section applies, or\n\n(ii) the process server's agent. Request for service\n\n6.50 The Senior Master will serve a document to which this Section applies upon receipt of -\n\n(a) a written request for service -\n\n(i) where the foreign court or tribunal is in a convention country, from a consular or other authority of that country; or\n\n(ii) from the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, with a recommendation that service should be effected;\n\n(b) a translation of that request into English;\n\n(c) two copies of the document to be served; and\n\n(d) unless the foreign court or tribunal certifies that the person to be served understands the language of the document, two copies of a translation of it into English.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 6 A - SERVICE WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Part 6\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nScope of this Practice Direction\n\n1.1 This Practice Direction supplements -\n\n(1) Section II (service of the claim form in the jurisdiction) of Part 6;\n\n(2) Section III (service of documents other than the claim form in the United Kingdom) of Part 6; and\n\n(3) rule 6.40 in relation to the method of service on a party in Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n\n(Practice Direction 6 B contains provisions relevant to service on a party in Scotland or Northern Ireland, including provisions about service out of the jurisdiction where permission is and is not required and the period for responding to an application notice.)\n\n---\n\nWhen service may be by document exchange\n\n2.1 Service by document exchange (DX) may take place only where -\n\n(1) the address at which the party is to be served includes a numbered box at a DX, or\n\n(2) the writing paper of the party who is to be served or of the solicitor acting for that party sets out a DX box number, and\n\n(3) the party or the solicitor acting for that party has not indicated in writing that they are unwilling to accept service by DX.\n\n---\n\nHow service is effected by post, an alternative service provider or DX\n\n3.1 Service by post, DX or other service which provides for delivery on the next business day is effected by -\n\n(1) placing the document in a post box;\n\n(2) leaving the document with or delivering the document to the relevant service provider; or\n\n(3) having the document collected by the relevant service provider.\n\n---\n\nService by fax or other electronic means\n\n4.1 Subject to the provisions of rule 6.23(5) and (6), where a document is to be served by fax or other electronic means -\n\n(1) the party who is to be served or the solicitor acting for that party must previously have indicated in writing to the party serving -\n\n(a) that the party to be served or the solicitor is willing to accept service by fax or other electronic means; and\n\n(b) the fax number, e-mail address or e-mail addresses or other electronic identification to which it must be sent; and\n\n(2) the following are to be taken as sufficient written indications for the purposes of paragraph 4.1(1) -\n\n(a) a fax number set out on the writing paper of the solicitor acting for the party to be served;\n\n(b) an e-mail address or e-mail addresses set out on the writing paper of the solicitor acting for the party to be served but only where it is stated that the e-mail address or e-mail addresses may be used for service; or\n\n(c) a fax number, e-mail addressore-mail addresses or electronic identification set out on a statement of case or a response to a claim filed with the court.\n\n(3) Where a party has indicated that service by email must be effected by sending a document to multiple e-mail addresses, the document may be served by sending it to any 2 of the e-mail addresses identified.\n\n4.2 Where a party intends to serve a document by electronic means (other than by fax) that party must first ask the party who is to be served whether there are any limitations to the recipient's agreement to accept service by such means (for example, the format in which documents are to be sent and the maximum size of attachments that may be received).\n\n4.3 Where a document is served by electronic means, the party serving the document need not in addition send or deliver a hard copy.\n\n---\n\nService on members of the Regular Forces and United States Air Force\n\n5.1 The provisions that apply to service on members of the regular forces (within the meaning of the Armed Forces Act 2006) and members of the United States Air Force are annexed to this practice direction.\n\n---\n\nPersonal service on a company or other corporation\n\n6.1 Personal service on a registered company or corporation in accordance with rule 6.5(3) is effected by leaving a document with a person holding a senior position.\n\n6.2 Each of the following persons is a person holding a senior position -\n\n(1) in respect of a registered company or corporation, a director, the treasurer, the secretary of the company or corporation, the chief executive, a manager or other officer of the company or corporation; and\n\n(2) in respect of a corporation which is not a registered company, in addition to any of the persons set out in sub-paragraph (1), the mayor, the chairman, the president, a town clerk or similar officer of the corporation.\n\n---\n\nCertificate of service where claimant serves the claim form\n\n7.1 Where, pursuant to rule 6.17(2), the claimant files a certificate of service, the claimant is not required to and should not file -\n\n(1) a further copy of the claim form with the certificate of service; and\n\n(2) a further copy of -\n\n(a) the particulars of claim (where not included in the claim form); or\n\n(b) any document attached to the particulars of claim,\n\nwith the certificate of service where that document has already been filed with the court.\n\n(Rule 7.4 requires the claimant to file a copy of the particulars of claim (where served separately from the claim form) within 7 days of service on the defendant.)\n\n---\n\nService by the court\n\n8.1 Where the court serves a document in accordance with rule 6.4 or 6.21(2), the method will normally be first class post.\n\n---\n\nApplication for an order for service by an alternative method or at an alternative place\n\n9.1 Where an application for an order under rule 6.15 is made before the document is served, the application must be supported by evidence stating -\n\n(1) the reason why an order is sought;\n\n(2) what alternative method or place is proposed, and\n\n(3) why the applicant believes that the document is likely to reach the person to be served by the method or at the place proposed.\n\n9.2 Where the application for an order is made after the applicant has taken steps to bring the document to the attention of the person to be served by an alternative method or at an alternative place, the application must be supported by evidence stating -\n\n(1) the reason why the order is sought;\n\n(2) what alternative method or alternative place was used;\n\n(3) when the alternative method or place was used; and\n\n(4) why the applicant believes that the document is likely to have reached the person to be served by the alternative method or at the alternative place.\n\n9.3 Examples -\n\n(1) an application to serve by posting or delivering to an address of a person who knows the other party must be supported by evidence that if posted or delivered to that address, the document is likely to be brought to the attention of the other party;\n\n(2) an application to serve by sending a SMS text message or leaving a voicemail message at a particular telephone number saying where the document is must be accompanied by evidence that the person serving the document has taken, or will take, appropriate steps to ensure that the party being served is using that telephone number and is likely to receive the message; and\n\n(3) an application to serve by e-mail to a company (where paragraph 4.1 does not apply) must be supported by evidence that the e-mail address to which the document will be sent is one which is likely to come to the attention of a person holding a senior position in that company.\n\n---\n\nDeemed service of a document other than a claim form\n\n10.1 Rule 6.26 contains provisions about deemed service of a document other than a claim form. Examples of how deemed service is calculated are set out below.\n\n10.2\n\nExample 1\n\nWhere the document is posted (by first class post) on a Monday (a business day), the day of deemed service is the following Wednesday (a business day).\n\n10.3\n\nExample 2\n\nWhere the document is left in a numbered box at the DX on a Friday (a business day), the day of deemed service is the following Monday (a business day).\n\n10.4\n\nExample 3\n\nWhere the document is sent by fax on a Saturday and the transmission of that fax is completed by 4.30 p.m. on that day, the day of deemed service is the following Monday (a business day).\n\n10.5\n\nExample 4\n\nWhere the document is served personally before 4.30 p.m. on a Sunday, the day of deemed service is the next day (Monday, a business day).\n\n10.6\n\nExample 5\n\nWhere the document is delivered to a permitted address after 4.30 p.m. on the Thursday (a business day) before Good Friday, the day of deemed service is the following Tuesday (a business day) as the Monday is a bank holiday.\n\n10.7\n\nExample 6\n\nWhere the document is posted (by first class post) on a bank holiday Monday, the day of deemed service is the following Wednesday (a business day).\n\n---\n\nAnnex\n\nService on Members of the Regular Forces\n\nThe following information is for litigants and legal representatives who wish to serve legal documents in civil proceedings in the courts of England and Wales on parties to the proceedings who are (or who, at the material time, were) members of the regular forces (as defined in the Armed Forces Act 2006).\n\nThe proceedings may take place in the county court or the High Court, and the documents to be served may be claim forms, interim application notices and pre-action application notices. Proceedings for divorce or maintenance and proceedings in the Family Courts generally are subject to special rules as to service which are explained in a practice direction issued by the Senior District Judge of the Principal Registry on 26 June 1979.\n\nIn this Annex, the person wishing to effect service is referred to as the 'claimant' and the member of the regular forces to be served is referred to as 'the member'; the expression 'overseas' means outside the United Kingdom.\n\nEnquiries as to address\n\nAs a first step, the claimant's legal representative will need to find out where the member is serving, if this is not already known. For this purpose the claimant's legal representative should write to the appropriate officer of the Ministry of Defence as specified in paragraph 10 below.\n\nThe letter of enquiry should in every case show that the writer is a legal representative and that the enquiry is made solely with a view to the service of legal documents in civil proceedings.\n\nIn all cases the letter must give the full name, service number, rank or rate, and Ship, Arm or Trade, Regiment or Corps and Unit or as much of this information as is available. Failure to quote the service number and the rank or rate may result either in failure to identify the member or in considerable delay.\n\nThe letter must contain an undertaking by the legal representative that, if the address is given, it will be used solely for the purpose of issuing and serving documents in the proceedings and that so far as is possible the legal representative will disclose the address only to the court and not to the claimant or to any other person or body. A legal representative in the service of a public authority or private company must undertake that the address will be used solely for the purpose of issuing and serving documents in the proceedings and that the address will not be disclosed so far as is possible to any other part of the legal representative's employing organisation or to any other person but only to the court. Normally on receipt of the required information and undertaking the appropriate office will give the service address.\n\nIf the legal representative does not give the undertaking, the only information that will be given is whether the member is at that time serving in England or Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland or overseas.\n\nIt should be noted that a member's address which ends with a British Forces Post Office address and reference (BFPO) will nearly always indicate that the member is serving overseas.\n\n10.\n\nThe letter of enquiry should be addressed as follows -\n\n(a)Royal Navy and Royal Marine Officers, Ratings and Other Ranks\n\nDirector Naval Personnel Fleet Headquarters MP 3.1 Leach Building Whale Island Portsmouth Hampshire PO 2 8 BY\n\nArmy Officers and other Ranks -\n\nArmy Personnel Centre Disclosures 1 MP 520 Kentigern House 65 Brown Street Glasgow G 2 8 EX\n\nRoyal Air Force Officers and Other Ranks -\n\nManning 22 ERAF Disclosures Room 221 BTrenchard Hall RAF Cranwell Sleaford Lincolnshire NG 34 8 HB\n\nAssistance in serving documents on members\n\n11.\n\nOnce the claimant's legal representative has ascertained the member's address, the legal representative may use that address as the address for service by post, in cases where this method of service is allowed by the Civil Procedure Rules. There are, however, some situations in which service of the proceedings, whether in the High Court or in the county court, must be effected personally; in these cases an appointment will have to be sought, through the Commanding Officer of the Unit, Establishment or Ship concerned, for the purpose of effecting service. The procedure for obtaining an appointment is described below, and it applies whether personal service is to be effected by the claimant's legal representative or the legal representative's agent or by a court bailiff, or, in the case of proceedings served overseas (with the leave of the court) through the British Consul or the foreign judicial authority.\n\n12.\n\nThe procedure for obtaining an appointment to effect personal service is by application to the Commanding Officer of the Unit, Establishment or Ship in which the member is serving. The Commanding Officer may grant permission for the document server to enter the Unit, Establishment or Ship but if this is not appropriate the Commanding Officer may offer arrangements for the member to attend at a place in the vicinity of the Unit, Establishment or Ship in order that the member may be served. If suitable arrangements cannot be made the legal representative will have evidence that personal service is impracticable, which may be useful in an application for service by an alternative method or at an alternative place.\n\nGeneral\n\n13.\n\nSubject to the procedure outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12, there are no special arrangements to assist in the service of legal documents when a member is outside the United Kingdom. The appropriate office will, however, give an approximate date when the member is likely to return to the United Kingdom.\n\n14.\n\nIt sometimes happens that a member has left the regular forces by the time an enquiry as to address is made. If the claimant's legal representative confirms that the proceedings result from an occurrence when the member was in the regular forces and the legal representative gives the undertaking referred to in paragraph 7, the last known private address after discharge will normally be provided. In no other case, however, will the Ministry of Defence disclose the private address of a member of the regular forces.\n\nService on Members of United States Air Force\n\n15.\n\nIn addition to the information contained in the memorandum of 26 July 1979, and after some doubts having been expressed as to the correct procedure to be followed by persons having civil claims against members of the United States Air Force in England and Wales, the Lord Chancellor's Office (as it was then) issued the following notes for guidance with the approval of the appropriate United States authorities.\n\n16.\n\nInstructions have been issued by the United States authorities to the commanding officers of all their units in England and Wales that every facility is to be given for the service of documents in civil proceedings on members of the United States Air Force. The proper course to be followed by a creditor or other person having a claim against a member of the United States Air Force is for that person to communicate with the commanding officer or, where the unit concerned has a legal officer, with the legal officer of the defendant's unit requesting the provision of facilities for the service of documents on the defendant. It is not possible for the United States authorities to act as arbitrators when a civil claim is made against a member of their forces. It is, therefore, essential that the claim should either be admitted by the defendant or judgment should be obtained on it, whether in the High Court or a county court. If a claim has been admitted or judgment has been obtained and the claimant has failed to obtain satisfaction within a reasonable period, the claimant's proper course is then to write to: Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Headquarters, Third Air Force, R.A.F. Mildenhall, Suffolk, enclosing a copy of the defendant's written admission of the claim or, as the case may be, a copy of the judgment. Steps will then be taken by the Staff Judge Advocate to ensure that the matter is brought to the defendant's attention with a view to prompt satisfaction of the claim.",

The claim form should, if issued in the High Court, be marked in the top right hand corner 'Business and Property Courts' and, if issued in the County Court, be marked 'Business and Property work' (except, in the County Court, for those areas listed as exceptions in paragraph 4.2 of Practice Direction 57 AA (Business and Property Courts).\n\n(For the equity jurisdiction of the County Court, see section 23 of the County Courts Act 1984.)\n\n2.7 A claim relating to any of the matters specified in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Senior Courts Act 1981 must be dealt with in the High Court and will be assigned to the King's Bench Division.\n\n2.8 Practice directions applying to particular types of proceedings, or to proceedings in particular courts, will contain provisions relating to the commencement and conduct of those proceedings.\n\n2.9 The following proceedings may not be started in the County Court unless the parties have agreed otherwise in writing-\n\n(1) a claim for damages or other remedy for libel or slander, and\n\n(2) a claim in which the title to any toll, fair, market or franchise is in question.\n\n2.10\n\n(1) Subject to paragraph 2.9, a claim relating to media and communications work (which includes any work which would fall within the jurisdiction of the Media and Communications List if issued in the High Court) may be started in the County Court or High Court; and paragraph 2.1 shall not apply to such a claim.\n\n(2) Such a claim should be started in the High Court if, by reason of the factors set out in paragraph 2.4(1) to (3), the claimant believes that the claim ought to be dealt with by a High Court judge.\n\n(3) If a claimant starts such a claim in the High Court and the court decides that it should have been started in the County Court, the court will normally transfer it to the County Court on its own initiative. This is likely to result in delay.\n\n2.11\n\n(1) The normal rules apply in deciding in which court and specialist list a claim that includes issues under the Human Rights Act 1998 should be started. They also apply in deciding which procedure to use to start the claim; this Part or CPR Part 8 or CPR Part 54 (judicial review).\n\n(2) The exception is a claim for damages in respect of a judicial act, which should be started in the High Court. If the claim is made in a notice of appeal then it will be dealt with according to the normal rules governing where that appeal is heard.\n\n(The County Court cannot make a declaration of incompatibility in accordance with section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Legislation may direct that such a claim is to be brought before a specified tribunal.)\n\n---\n\nThe claim form\n\n3.1 A claimant must use form N 1 to start a claim under Part 7.\n\n3.2 Other practice directions may require other forms to be used to start types of proceedings, or proceedings in particular courts.\n\n3.3 Where a claim form to be served out of the jurisdiction is one which the court has power to deal with under-\n\n(a) the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982; and\n\n(b) the Judgments Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters),the claim form must, under rule 6.34, be filed and served with the notice referred to in that rule and paragraph 2.1 of Practice Direction 6 B.\n\n3.4 If a claim for damages or for an unspecified sum is started in the High Court, the claim form must-\n\n(1) state that the claimant expects to recover more than £100,000 (or £50,000 or more if the claim is for personal injuries); or\n\n(2) state that some enactment provides that the claim may only be started in the High Court and specify that enactment; or\n\n(3) state that the claim is to be in one of the specialist High Court lists (see CPR Parts 49 and 58-62) and specify that list.\n\n3.5 If a claim for damages for personal injuries is started in the County Court, the claim form must state whether or not the claimant expects to recover more than £1000 in respect of pain, suffering and loss of amenity.\n\n3.6 If a claim for housing disrepair which includes a claim for an order requiring repairs or other work to be carried out by the landlord is started in the County Court, the claim form must state-\n\n(1) whether or not the cost of the repairs or other work is estimated to be more than £1000, and\n\n(2) whether or not the claimant expects to recover more than £1000 in respect of any claim for damages.\n\nIf either of the amounts mentioned in (1) and (2) is more than £1000, the small claims track will not be the normal track for that claim.\n\n---\n\nTitle of proceedings\n\n4.1 The claim form and every other statement of case, must be headed with the title of the proceedings. The title should state-\n\n(1) the identifying number given to the proceedings;\n\n(2) the court or Division in which they are proceeding;\n\n(3) the full name of each party;\n\n(4) each party's status in the proceedings (i.e. claimant/defendant).\n\n(Paragraph 2.4 of Practice Direction 16 sets out what is meant by a full name in respect of each type of claimant.)\n\n4.2 Where there is more than one claimant and/or more than one defendant, the parties should be described in the title as follows-\n\n1. [Name of first claimant]2. [Name of second claimant, etc]and 1. [Name of first defendant]2. [Name of second defendant, etc]\n\n---\n\nStarting a Part 7 Claim in the County Court\n\n5.1(1) Subject to subparagraph (2), if a claim-\n\n(a) is started in the County Court under Part 7;\n\n(b) is a claim only for an amount of money, whether specified or unspecified; and\n\n(c) is not a claim for which special procedures are provided in the Civil Procedure Rules or practice directions, form N 1 must be sent to: Civil National Business Centre, St Katharine's House, 21-27 St Katharine's Street, Northampton, NN 1 2 LH, DX 702885 Northampton 7.\n\n(2) For the purpose of this practice direction, the procedure in Practice Direction 49 D is not a special procedure.\n\n5.2 In proceedings referred to in paragraph 4 A.1, the claimant must specify the preferred hearing centre on form N 1.\n\n---\n\nStart of proceedings\n\n6.1 Proceedings are started when the court issues a claim form at the request of the claimant (see rule 7.2) but where the claim form as issued was received in the court office on a date earlier than the date on which it was issued by the court, the claim is \"brought\" for the purposes of the Limitation Act 1980 and any other relevant statute on that earlier date.\n\n6.2 The date on which the claim form was received by the court will be recorded by a date stamp either on the claim form held on the court file or on the letter that accompanied the claim form when it was received by the court.\n\n6.3 An enquiry about the date on which the claim form was received by the court should be directed to a court officer.\n\n6.4 Parties proposing to start a claim which is approaching the expiry of the limitation period should recognise the potential importance of establishing the date the claim form was received by the court and should themselves make arrangements to record the date.\n\n6.5 Where a person seeks to start proceedings against the estate of a deceased defendant where probate or letters of administration have not been granted, the claimant should issue the claim against \"the personal representatives of A.B. deceased\". The claimant should then, before the expiry of the period for service of the claim form, apply to the court for the appointment of a person to represent the estate of the deceased.\n\n---\n\nClaims by and against partnerships within the jurisdiction\n\n7.1 Paragraphs 7 and 8 apply to claims that are brought by or against two or more persons who-\n\n(1) were business partners; and\n\n(2) carried on that partnership business within the jurisdiction, at the time when the cause of action accrued.\n\n7.2 For the purposes of this paragraph, \"partners\" includes persons claiming to be entitled as partners and persons alleged to be partners.\n\n7.3 Where that partnership has a name, unless it is inappropriate to do so, claims must be brought in or against the name under which that partnership carried on business at the time the cause of action accrued.\n\n---\n\nPartnership membership statements\n\n8.1 In this paragraph a 'partnership membership statement' is a written statement of the names and last known places of residence of all the persons who were partners in the partnership at the time when the cause of action accrued, being the date specified for this purpose in accordance with paragraph 8.3.\n\n8.2 If the partners are requested to provide a copy of a partnership membership statement by any party to a claim, the partners must do so within 14 days of receipt of the request.\n\n8.3 In that request the party seeking a copy of a partnership membership statement must specify the date when the relevant cause of action accrued.\n\n(Signing of the acknowledgment of service in the case of a partnership is dealt with in CPR rule 10.5(5).)\n\n---\n\nPersons carrying on business in another name\n\n9.1 This paragraph applies where-\n\n(1) a claim is brought against an individual;\n\n(2) that individual carries on a business within the jurisdiction (even if not personally within the jurisdiction); and\n\n(3) that business is carried on in a name other than that individual's own name (\"the business name\").\n\n9.2 The claim may be brought against the business name as if it were the name of a partnership.\n\n---\n\nStatement of truth\n\n10.1 The form of a statement of truth is specified in paragraph 2.1 of Practice Direction 22.\n\n10.2 Attention is drawn to rule 32.14 which sets out the consequences of verifying a statement of case containing a false statement without an honest belief in its truth.\n\n---\n\nExtension of time\n\n11.1 An application under rule 7.6 (for an extension of time for serving a claim form under rule 7.6(1)) must be made in accordance with Part 23 and supported by evidence.\n\n11.2 The evidence should state-\n\n(1) all the circumstances relied on,\n\n(2) the date of issue of the claim,\n\n(3) the expiry date of any rule 7.6 extension, and\n\n(4) a full explanation as to why the claim has not been served.\n\n(For information regarding (1) written evidence see Part 32 and Practice Direction 32 and (2) service of the claim form see Part 6 and Practice Directions 6 A and 6 B.)",

    "content": "PART 12 - DEFAULT JUDGMENT\n\n---\n\nContents of this Part\n\n---\n\nMeaning of 'default judgment'\n\n12.1 In these Rules, 'default judgment' means judgment without trial where a defendant-\n\n(a) has failed to file an acknowledgment of service; or\n\n(b) has failed to file a defence or any document intended to be a defence.\n\n---\n\nClaims in which default judgment may not be obtained\n\n12.2 A claimant may not obtain a default judgment-\n\n(a) on a claim for delivery of goods subject to an agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 19741;\n\n(b) where they use the procedure set out in Part 8 (alternative procedure for claims); or\n\n(c) in any other case where a rule or practice direction says that the claimant may not obtain default judgment.\n\n---\n\nConditions to be satisfied\n\n12.3\n\n(1) The claimant may obtain judgment in default of an acknowledgment of service only if at the date on which judgment is entered-\n\n(a)t he defendant has not filed an acknowledgment of service or a defence to the claim (or any part of the claim); and\n\n(b) the relevant time for doing so has expired.\n\n(2) Judgment in default of defence (or any document intended to be a defence) may be obtained only-\n\n(a) where an acknowledgement of service has been filed but, at the date on which judgment is entered, a defence has not been filed;\n\n(b) in a counterclaim made under rule 20.4, where at the date on which judgment is entered a defence has not been filed,\n\nand, in either case, the relevant time limit for doing so has expired.\n\n(Rule 20.4 makes general provision for a defendant's counterclaim against a claimant, and rule 20.4(3) provides that Part 10 (acknowledgement of service) does not apply to a counterclaim made under that rule.)\n\n(3) The claimant may not obtain a default judgment if at the time the court is considering the issue-\n\n(a) the defendant has applied-\n\n(i) to have the claimant's statement of case struck out under rule 3.4; or\n\n(ii) for summary judgment under Part 24,\n\nand, in either case, that application has not been dealt with;\n\n(b) the defendant has satisfied the whole claim (including any claim for costs) on which the claimant is seeking judgment;\n\n(c)\n\n(i) the claimant is seeking judgment on a claim for money; and\n\n(ii) the defendant has admitted liability to pay all the money claimed but has requested time to pay; or\n\n(d) notice has been given under rule 82.21 of a person's intention to make an application for a declaration under section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013(2) in relation to the proceedings, and that application has not been dealt with.\n\n(Part 14 sets out the procedure where a defendant admits a money claim and asks for time to pay.)\n\n(Rule 6.17 provides that, where the claim form is served by the claimant, the claimant may not obtain default judgment unless a certificate of service has been filed.)\n\n---\n\nProcedure for obtaining default judgment\n\n12.4\n\n(1) Subject to paragraph (3), a claimant may obtain a default judgment by filing a request in the relevant practice form where the claim is for-\n\n(a) a specified amount of money (Form N 205 A or N 225);\n\n(b) an amount of money to be decided by the court (Form N 205 B or N 227);\n\n(c) delivery of goods where the claim form gives the defendant the alternative of paying their value (N 205 A, N 225); or\n\n(d) any combination of these remedies.\n\n(2) Where the defendant is an individual, the claimant must provide the defendant's date of birth (if known) where required in the form.\n\n(3) The claimant must make an application in accordance with Part 23 if they wish to obtain a default judgment-\n\n(a) on a claim which consists of or includes a claim for any other remedy;

The date must allow the second party a reasonable time to respond.\n\n1.2 A Request should be concise and strictly confined to matters which are reasonably necessary and proportionate to enable the first party to prepare his own case or to understand the case he has to meet.\n\n1.3 Requests must be made as far as possible in a single comprehensive document and not piecemeal.\n\n1.4 A Request may be made by letter if the text of the Request is brief and the reply is likely to be brief; otherwise the Request should be made in a separate document.\n\n1.5 If a Request is made in a letter, the letter should, in order to distinguish it from any other that might routinely be written in the course of a case,\n\n(1) state that it contains a Request made under Part 18, and\n\n(2) deal with no matters other than the Request.\n\n1.6\n\n(1) A Request (whether made by letter or in a separate document) must -\n\n(a) be headed with the name of the court and the title and number of the claim,\n\n(b) in its heading state that it is a Request made under Part 18, identify the first party and the second party and state the date on which it is made,\n\n(c) set out in a separate numbered paragraph each request for information or clarification,\n\n(d) where a Request relates to a document, identify that document and (if relevant) the paragraph or words to which it relates,\n\n(e) state the date by which the first party expects a response to the Request.\n\n(2)\n\n(a) A Request which is not in the form of a letter may, if convenient, be prepared in such a way that the response may be given on the same document.\n\n(b) To do this the numbered paragraphs of the Request should appear on the left hand half of each sheet so that the paragraphs of the response may then appear on the right.\n\n(c) Where a Request is prepared in this form an extra copy should be served for the use of the second party.\n\n1.7 Subject to the provisions of rule 6.23(5) and (6) and paragraphs 4.1 to 4.3 of Practice Direction 6 A, a request should be served by e-mail if reasonably practicable.\n\n---\n\nResponding to a Request\n\n2.1 A response to a Request must be in writing, dated and signed by the second party or his legal representative.\n\n2.2\n\n(1) Where the Request is made in a letter the second party may give his response in a letter or in a formal reply.\n\n(2) Such a letter should identify itself as a response to the Request and deal with no other matters than the response.\n\n2.3\n\n(1) Unless the Request is in the format described in paragraph 1.6(2) and the second party uses the document supplied for the purpose, a response must:\n\n(a) be headed with the name of the court and the title and number of the claim,\n\n(b) in its heading identify itself as a response to that Request,\n\n(c) repeat the text of each separate paragraph of the Request and set out under each paragraph the response to it,\n\n(d) refer to and have attached to it a copy of any document not already in the possession of the first party which forms part of the response.\n\n(2) A second or supplementary response to a Request must identify itself as such in its heading.\n\n2.4\n\nThe second party must when he serves his response on the first party serve on every other party and file with the court a copy of the Request and of his response.\n\n---\n\nStatements of Truth\n\n3 Attention is drawn to Part 22 and to the definition of a statement of case in Part 2 of the rules; a response should be verified by a statement of truth.\n\n---\n\nGeneral matters\n\n4.1\n\n(1) If the second party objects to complying with the Request or part of it or is unable to do so at all or within the time stated in the Request he must inform the first party promptly and in any event within that time.\n\n(2) He may do so in a letter or in a separate document (a formal response), but in either case he must give reasons and, where relevant, give a date by which he expects to be able to comply.\n\n4.2\n\n(1) There is no need for a second party to apply to the court if he objects to a Request or is unable to comply with it at all or within the stated time. He need only comply with paragraph 4.1(1) above.\n\n(2) Where a second party considers that a Request can only be complied with at disproportionate expense and objects to comply for that reason he should say so in his reply and explain briefly why he has taken that view.\n\nApplications for Orders under Part 18\n\n5.1 Attention is drawn to Part 23 (Applications) and to Practice Direction 23 A.\n\n5.2 An application notice for an order under Part 18 should set out or have attached to it the text of the order sought and in particular should specify the matter or matters in respect of which the clarification or information is sought.\n\n5.3\n\n(1) If a Request under paragraph 1 for the information or clarification has not been made, the application notice should, in addition, explain why not.\n\n(2) If a Request for clarification or information has been made, the application notice or the evidence in support should describe the response, if any.\n\n5.4 Both the first party and the second party should consider whether evidence in support of or in opposition to the application is required.\n\n5.5\n\n(1) Where the second party has made no response to a Request served on him, the first party need not serve the application notice on the second party, and the court may deal with the application without a hearing.\n\n(2) Sub-paragraph (1) above only applies if at least 14 days have passed since the Request was served and the time stated in it for a response has expired.\n\n5.6\n\nUnless paragraph 5.5 applies the application notice must be served on the second party and on all other parties to the claim.\n\n5.7 An order made under Part 18 must be served on all parties to the claim.\n\n5.8 Costs:\n\n(1) Attention is drawn to the Practice Directions 44 to 48 on costs and, in particular, Subsections 8 and 9 of Practice Direction 44, which relate to the court's power to make a summary assessment of costs.\n\n(2) Attention is also drawn to rule 44.10(1) which provides that the general rule is that if an order does not mention costs no party is entitled to costs relating to that order.",

and\n\n(c) a notice of a judgment or order must also be accompanied by a copy of the judgment or order.\n\n(5) If a person served with notice of a claim files an acknowledgment of service of the notice within 14 days they will become a party to the claim.\n\n(6) If a person served with notice of a claim does not acknowledge service of the notice they will be bound by any judgment given in the claim as if they were a party.\n\n(7) If, after service of a notice of a claim on a person, the claim form is amended so as substantially to alter the relief claimed, the court may direct that a judgment shall not bind that person unless a further notice, together with a copy of the amended claim form, is served on them.\n\n(8) Any person served with a notice of a judgment or order under this rule -\n\n(a) shall be bound by the judgment or order as if they had been a party to the claim; but\n\n(b) may, provided they acknowledges service -\n\n(i) within 28 days after the notice is served on them, apply to the court to set aside or vary the judgment or order; and\n\n(ii) take part in any proceedings relating to the judgment or order.\n\n(9) The following rules of Part 10 (acknowledgment of service) apply -\n\n(b) rule 10.5, subject to the modification that references to the defendant are to be read as references to the person served with the notice.\n\n(10) A notice under this rule is issued on the date entered on the notice by the court.\n\n---\n\nDerivative claims - how started\n\n19.14\n\n(1) This rule -\n\n(a) applies to a derivative claim (where a company, other body corporate or trade union is alleged to be entitled to claim a remedy, and a claim is made by a member of it for it to be given that remedy), whether under Chapter 1 of Part 11 of the Companies Act 20063 or otherwise; but\n\n(b) does not apply to a claim made pursuant to an order under section 996 of that Act.\n\n(2) A derivative claim must be started by a claim form headed \"Derivative Claim\".\n\n(3) The company, body corporate or trade union for the benefit of which a remedy is sought must be made a defendant to the claim.\n\n(4) After the issue of the claim form, the claimant must not take any further step in the proceedings without the permission of the court, other than -\n\n(a) a step permitted or required by rule 19.15 or 19.17;

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 19 B - GROUP LITIGATION\n\nThis practice direction supplements Section III of Part 19\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\nIntroduction\n\n1 This practice direction deals with group litigation where the multiple parties are claimants. Section III of Part 19 (group litigation orders) also applies where the multiple parties are defendants. The court will give such directions in such a case as are appropriate.\n\n---\n\nPreliminary steps\n\n2.1 Before applying for a Group Litigation Order ('GLO') the solicitor acting for the proposed applicant should consult the Law Society's Multi Party Action Information Service in order to obtain information about other cases giving rise to the proposed GLO issues.\n\n2.2 It will often be convenient for the claimants' solicitors to form a Solicitors' Group and to choose one of that Group to take the lead in applying for the GLO and in litigating the GLO issues. The lead solicitor's role and relationship with the other members of the Solicitors' Group should be carefully defined in writing and will be subject to any directions given by the court under CPR 19.24(c).\n\n2.3 In considering whether to apply for a GLO, the applicant should consider whether any other order would be more appropriate, and in particular whether, in the circumstances of the case, it would be more appropriate for -\n\n(1) the claims to be consolidated; or\n\n(2) the rules in Section II of Part 19 (representative parties) to be used.\n\n---\n\nApplication for a GLO\n\n3.1 An application for a GLO must be made in accordance with CPR Part 23, may be made at any time before or after any relevant claims have been issued and may be made either by a claimant or by a defendant.\n\n3.2 The following information should be included in the application notice or in written evidence filed in support of the application:\n\n(1) a summary of the nature of the litigation;\n\n(2) the number and nature of claims already issued;\n\n(3) the number of parties likely to be involved;\n\n(4) the common issues of fact or law (the 'GLO issues') that are likely to arise in the litigation; and\n\n(5) whether there are any matters that distinguish smaller groups of claims within the wider group.\n\n3.3 Omitted\n\n3.4 The court to which the application for a GLO is made will, if minded to make the GLO, seek the consent of the President of the King's Bench Division, the Chancellor of the High Court, or the Head of Civil Justice, as appropriate, to the making of the GLO and send to them -\n\n(1) a copy of the application notice,\n\n(2) a copy of any relevant written evidence, and\n\n(3) a written statement as to why a GLO is considered to be desirable.\n\nThese steps may be taken either before or after a hearing of the application.\n\n---\n\nHigh Court in London\n\n3.5 The application for the GLO should be made to the Senior Master in the King's Bench Division or the Chief Chancery Master in the Chancery Division. For claims that are proceeding or are likely to proceed in a specialist list, the application should be made to the senior judge of that list.\n\n---\n\nHigh Court outside London\n\n3.6 Outside London, the application should be made to a Presiding Judge or a Chancery Supervising Judge of the Circuit in which the District Registry which has issued the application notice is situated.\n\n---\n\nThe County Court\n\n3.7 Where the application notice is issued in the County Court, the application should be made to the Designated Civil Judge for the area in which the application notice has been issued.\n\n3.8 The applicant for a GLO should request the relevant County Court hearing centre to refer the application notice to the judge by whom the application will be heard as soon as possible after the application notice has been issued. This is to enable the judge to consider whether to follow the practice set out in paragraph 3.4 above prior to the hearing of the application.\n\n3.9 The directions under paragraphs 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 above do not prevent the judges referred to from making arrangements for other judges to hear applications for GLOs when they themselves are unavailable.\n\n---\n\nGLO made by court of its own initiative\n\n4 Subject to paragraph 3.4, the court may make a GLO of its own initiative.\n\nThe GLO\n\n5 CPR 19.11(2) and (3) set out rules relating to the contents of GLOs.\n\n---\n\nThe Group Register\n\n6.1 Once a GLO has been made a Group Register will be established on which will be entered such details as the court may direct of the cases which are to be subject to the GLO.\n\n6.1 AA claim must be issued before it can be entered on a Group Register.\n\n6.2 An application for details of a case to be entered on a Group Register may be made by any party to the case.\n\n6.3 An order for details of the case to be entered on the Group Register will not be made unless the case gives rise to at least one of the GLO issues.\n\n(CPR 19.21 defines GLO issues)\n\n6.4 The court, if it is not satisfied that a case can be conveniently case managed with the other cases on the Group Register, or if it is satisfied that the entry of the case on the Group Register would adversely affect the case management of the other cases, may refuse to allow details of the case to be entered on the Group Register, or order their removal from the Register if already entered, although the case gives rise to one or more of the Group issues.\n\n6.5 The court will normally order that the Group Register be established and maintained by the lead claimant solicitors.\n\n6.6\n\n(1) Rules 5.4 (Register of Claims), 5.4 B (Supply of documents from court records - a party) and 5.4 C (supply of documents from court records - a non-party) apply where the register is maintained by the court. A party to a claim on the group register may request documents relating to any other claim on the group register in accordance with rule 5.4 as if they were a party to those proceedings.\n\n(2) Where the register is maintained by a solicitor, any person may inspect the Group Register during normal business hours and upon giving reasonable notice to the solicitor; the solicitor may charge a fee not exceeding the fee prescribed for a search at the court office.\n\n6.7 In this paragraph, 'the court' means the management court specified in the GLO.\n\n---\n\nAllocation to track\n\n7 Once a GLO has been made and unless the management court directs otherwise:\n\n(1) every claim in a case entered on the Group Register will be automatically allocated, or re-allocated, to the multi-track;\n\n(2) any case management directions that have already been given in any such case otherwise than by the management court will be set aside; and\n\n(3) any hearing date already fixed otherwise than for the purposes of the group litigation will be vacated.\n\n---\n\nManaging judge\n\n8.1 A judge ('the managing judge') will be appointed for the purpose of the GLO as soon as possible. They will assume overall responsibility fo the management of the claims and will generally hear the GLO issues. A Master or a District Judge may be appointed to deal with procedural matters, which they will do in accordance with any directions given by the managing judge. A costs judge may be appointed and may be invited to attend case management hearings.\n\n8.2 When the managing judge has been appointed, the lead claimant solicitors shall provide the name of the managing judge to the same addresses as in paragraph 11 below.\n\n---\n\nClaims to be started in management court\n\n9.1 The management court may order that as from a specified date all claims that raise one or more of the GLO issues shall be started in the management court.\n\n9.2 Failure to comply with an order made under paragraph 9.1 will not invalidate the commencement of the claim but the claim should be transferred to the management court and details entered on the Group Register as soon as possible. Any party to the claim may apply to the management court for an order under CPR 19.14 removing the case from the Register or, for an order that details of the case be not entered on the Register.\n\n---\n\nTransfer\n\n10 Where the management court is in the County Court and a claim raising one or more of the GLO issues is proceeding in the High Court, an order transferring the case to the management court and directing the details of the case to be entered on the Group Register can only be made in the High Court.\n\n---\n\nPublicising the GLO\n\n11 After a GLO has been made, a copy of the GLO should be supplied -\n\n(1) to the Law Society, 113 Chancery Lane, London WC 2 A 1 PL; and\n\n(2) to-\n\n(a)GLO-KBD@justice.gov.ukin respect of GLOs made in the King's Bench Division; or\n\n(b)GLO-Chancery@justice.gov.ukin respect of GLOs made in the Chancery Division.\n\n---\n\nCase management\n\n12.1 The management court may give case management directions at the time the GLO is made or subsequently.\n\n12.2 Any application to vary the terms of the GLO must be made to the management court.\n\n12.3 The management court may direct that one or more of the claims are to proceed as test claims.\n\n12.4 The management court may give directions about how the costs of resolving common issues or the costs of claims proceeding as test claims are to be borne or shared as between the claimants on the Group Register.\n\n---\n\nCut-off dates\n\n13 The management court may specify a date after which no claim may be added to the Group Register unless the court gives permission. An early cut-off date may be appropriate in the case of 'instant disasters' (such as transport accidents). In the case of consumer claims, and particularly pharmaceutical claims, it may be necessary to delay the ordering of a cut-off date.\n\n---\n\nStatements of case\n\n14.1 The management court may direct that the GLO claimants serve 'Group Particulars of Claim' which set out the various claims of all the claimants on the Group Register at the time the particulars are filed. Such particulars of claim will usually contain -\n\n(1) general allegations relating to all claims; and\n\n(2) a schedule containing entries relating to each individual claim specifying which of the general allegations are relied on and any specific facts relevant to the claimant.\n\n14.2 The directions given under paragraph 14.1 should include directions as to whether the Group Particulars should be verified by a statement or statements of truth and, if so, by whom.\n\n14.3 The specific facts relating to each claimant on the Group Register may be obtained by the use of a questionnaire. Where this is proposed, the management court should be asked to approve the questionnaire. The management court may direct that the questionnaires completed by individual claimants take the place of the schedule referred to in paragraph 14.1(2).\n\n14.4 The management court may also give directions about the form that particulars of claim relating to claims which are to be entered on the Group Register should take.\n\n---\n\nThe trial\n\n15.1 The management court may give directions -\n\n(1) for the trial of common issues; and\n\n(2) for the trial of individual issues.\n\n15.2 Common issues and test claims will normally be tried at the management court. Individual issues may be directed to be tried at other courts whose locality is convenient for the parties.\n\n---\n\nCosts\n\n16.1 CPR 46 contains rules about costs where a GLO has been made.\n\n16.2 Where the court has made an order about costs in relation to any application or hearing which involved both -\n\n(1) one or more of the GLO issues; and\n\n(2) an issue or issues relevant only to individual claims;\n\nand the court has not directed the proportion of the costs that is to relate to common costs and the proportion that is to relate to individual costs in accordance with rule 46.6(5), the costs judge will make a decision as to the relevant proportions at or before the commencement of the detailed assessment of costs.",

or\n\n(c) require an additional claim to be dealt with separately from the claim by the claimant against the defendant.\n\n(Rule 3.1(2)(e) and (j) deal respectively with the court's power to order that part of proceedings be dealt with as separate proceedings and to decide the order in which issues are to be tried).\n\n(2) The matters which the court may consider include -\n\n(a) the connection between the additional claim and the claim made by the claimant against the defendant;\n\n(b) whether the additional claimant is seeking substantially the same remedy which some other party is claiming from them;

or\n\n(ii) against an existing party not only in a capacity in which they are already a party but also in some further capacity.\n\n---\n\nEffect of service of an additional claim\n\n20.10 A person on whom an additional claim is served becomes a party to the proceedings if they are not a party already.\n\n---\n\nSpecial provisions relating to default judgment on an additional claim other than a counterclaim or a contribution or indemnity notice\n\n20.11\n\n(1) This rule applies if -\n\n(a) the additional claim is not -\n\n(i) a counterclaim;

This will normally be at the same time as a case management hearing for the original claim and any other additional claims.\n\n3.2 The court will give notice of the hearing to each party likely to be affected by any order made at the hearing.\n\n3.3 At the hearing the court may:\n\n(1) treat the hearing as a summary judgment hearing,\n\n(2) order that the additional claim be dismissed,\n\n(3) give directions about the way any claim, question or issue set out in or arising from the additional claim should be dealt with,\n\n(4) give directions as to the part, if any, the additional defendant will take at the trial of the claim,\n\n(5) give directions about the extent to which the additional defendant is to be bound by any judgment or decision to be made in the claim.\n\n3.4 The court may make any of the orders in 3.3(1) to (5) either before or after any judgment in the claim has been entered by the claimant against the defendant.\n\n---\n\nForm of counterclaim\n\n4.1 Where a defendant to a claim serves a counterclaim, the defence and counterclaim should normally form one document with the counterclaim following on from the defence.\n\n4.2 Where a claimant serves a reply and a defence to counterclaim, the reply and the defence to counterclaim should normally form one document with the defence to counterclaim following on from the reply.\n\n---\n\nTitles of proceedings where there are additional claims\n\n5.1 Where there are additional claims which add parties, the title to the proceedings should comprise a list of all parties describing each by giving them a single identification. As far as possible, this identification should be used throughout.\n\n5.2 Claimants and defendants in the original claim should always be referred to as such in the title to the proceedings, even if they subsequently acquire an additional procedural status.\n\n5.3 Additional parties should be referred to in the title to the proceedings in accordance with the order in which they are joined to the proceedings, for example 'Third Party' or 'Fourth Party', whatever their actual procedural status.\n\nExamples:\n\n(a) If the defendant makes an additional claim against a single additional party, the additional party should be referred to in the title as 'Third Party'.\n\n(b) If the defendant makes separate additional claims against two additional parties, the additional parties should be referred to in the title as 'Third Party' and 'Fourth Party'.\n\n(c) If the defendant makes a counterclaim against the claimant and an additional party, the claimant should remain as 'Claimant' and the additional party should be referred to in the title as 'Third Party'.\n\n(d) If the Third Party in example (b) makes an additional claim against a further additional party, that additional party should be referred to in the title as 'Fifth Party'.\n\n5.4 If an additional claim is brought against more than one party jointly, they should be referred to in the title to the proceedings as, for example, 'First Named Third Party' and 'Second Named Third Party'.\n\n5.5 In group litigation, the court should give directions about the designation of parties.\n\n5.6 All parties should co-operate to ensure that two parties each making additional claims do not attribute the same nominal status to more than one party.\n\n5.7 In proceedings with numerous parties, the court will if necessary give directions as to the preparation and updating of a list of parties giving their roles in the claim and each additional claim.\n\n5.8 If an additional party ceases to be a party to the proceedings, for example because the claim against that party is discontinued or dismissed, all other additional parties should retain their existing nominal status.\n\n5.9 In proceedings where there are additional parties, the description of all statements of case or other similar documents should clearly identify the nature of the document with reference to each relevant party.\n\nExamples:\n\n(e) In example (a), the defendant's additional claim should be headed 'Defendant's Additional Claim against Third Party' and the Third Party's defence to it should be headed 'Third Party's Defence to Defendant's Additional Claim'.\n\n(f) In example (c), the defendant's counterclaim should be headed 'Defendant's Counterclaim against Claimant and Third Party' and the Third Party's defence to it should be headed 'Third Party's defence to Defendant's Counterclaim'.\n\n5.10 In proceedings where there are Fourth or subsequent parties, additional parties should be referred to in the text of statements of case or other similar documents by name, suitably abbreviated if appropriate. If parties have similar names, suitable distinguishing abbreviations should be used.",

or\n\n(b) money paid into court is accepted by or on behalf of a child or protected party,\n\nthe money will be dealt with in accordance with directions given by the court under this rule and not otherwise.\n\n(2) Directions given under this rule may provide that the money shall be wholly or partly paid into court and invested or otherwise dealt with.\n\n(3) Where money is recovered by or on behalf of a protected party or money paid into court is accepted by or on behalf of a protected party, before giving directions under this rule, the court will first consider whether the protected party is a protected beneficiary.\n\n(4) Where a child lacks capacity to manage and control any money recovered by or on behalf of the child, and is likely to remain so on reaching full age, the fund will be administered as a protected beneficiary's fund.\n\n(5) Where a child or protected beneficiary is in receipt of publicly funded legal services the fund shall be subject to a first charge under section 25 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012(1) (statutory charge) and an order for the investment of money on the child's or protected beneficiary's behalf must contain a direction to that effect.\n\n(6) The representative or litigation friend of the child or protected beneficiary must apply to the court for directions for management of the fund or payment into court (using Form CFO 320 or CFO 320 PB to be completed by the judge), stating the nature and terms of any proposed investment vehicle, with appropriate supporting evidence.\n\n(7) The judge hearing the application may adjourn it and give directions for further information to be provided and, unless the judge directs otherwise, the money recovered will be paid into the court special account pending determination of the application for investment.\n\n(8) Where money is recovered for the benefit of a child who is not a protected beneficiary-\n\n(a) if the court considers it appropriate, it may order that the money be paid directly to the litigation friend to be placed in a bank, building society or similar account for the child's use;\n\n(b) if the money remains invested in court, it must be paid out to the child when the child reaches the age of 18;\n\n(c) any investments held in court other than money must either be sold and the proceeds paid to the child, or transferred to the child, when the child reaches the age of 18.\n\n(9) Where money is recovered for the benefit of a protected beneficiary-\n\n(a) if the amount is £100,000 or more, subject to (b) below, the court shall direct the litigation friend to apply to the Court of Protection for the appointment of a deputy, after which the fund shall be dealt with as directed by the Court of Protection;\n\n(b) the procedure in sub-paragraph (a) will not apply where a person with authority to administer the protected beneficiary's financial affairs has been appointed as attorney under a registered enduring power of attorney, or as donee of a registered lasting power of attorney, or as the deputy appointed by the Court of Protection;\n\n(c) any payment out of money must be in accordance with any decision or order of the Court of Protection;\n\n(d) if an application to the Court of Protection is required, that application must be made;\n\n(e) if the Court of Protection so decides, on its own initiative or at the request of the judge hearing the application for investment, an amount exceeding £100,000 may be retained in court and invested in the same way as the fund of a child.\n\n(10) A request for payment of money from a fund held for the benefit of a child or protected party, or to vary an investment strategy, may be made in writing with appropriate supporting evidence (but without making a formal application) to a Master or District Judge and may be determined without a hearing unless the court directs otherwise.\n\n---\n\nCosts and expenses incurred by a litigation friend\n\n21.12\n\n(1) In proceedings to which rule 21.11 applies, a litigation friend who incurs costs or expenses on behalf of a child or protected party in any proceedings is entitled on application to recover the amount paid or payable out of any money recovered or paid into court to the extent that it -\n\n(a) has been reasonably incurred; and\n\n(b) is reasonable in amount.\n\n(2) Costs recoverable in respect of a child under this rule are limited to-\n\n(a) costs which have been assessed by way of detailed assessment under rule 46.4(2);\n\n(b) costs incurred by way of success fee under a conditional fee agreement or sum payable under a damages based agreement in a claim for damages for personal injury where the damages agreed or ordered to be paid do not exceed £25,000, where such costs have been summarily assessed under rule 46.4(5), or\n\n(c) costs incurred where a detailed assessment of costs has been dispensed with under rule 46.4(3) in the circumstances set out in Practice Direction 46.\n\n(3) Expenses may include all or part of -\n\n(a) a premium in respect of a costs insurance policy (as defined by section 58 C(5) of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990); or\n\n(b) interest on a loan taken out to pay a premium in respect of a costs insurance policy or other recoverable disbursement.\n\n(4) No application may be made under this rule for costs or expenses that -\n\n(a) are of a type that may be recoverable on an assessment of costs payable by or out of money belonging to a child or protected party; but\n\n(b) are disallowed in whole or in part on such an assessment.\n\n(Costs and expenses which are also \"costs\" as defined in rule 44.1(1) are subject to rule 46.4(2) and (3).)\n\n(5) In deciding whether the costs or expenses were reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount, the court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the factors set out in rule 44.4(3) and 46.9.\n\n(6) When the court is considering the factors to be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of the costs or expenses, it will have regard to the facts and circumstances as they reasonably appeared to the litigation friend or to the child's or protected party's legal representative or deputy when the cost or expense was incurred.\n\n(7) Subject to paragraph (7), where the claim is settled or compromised, or judgment is given, on terms that an amount not exceeding £5,000 is paid to the child or protected party, the total amount the litigation friend may recover under paragraph (1) must not exceed 25% of the sum so agreed or awarded, unless the court directs otherwise. Such total amount must not exceed 50% of the sum so agreed or awarded.\n\n(8) The amount which the litigation friend may recover under paragraph (1) in respect of costs must not (in proceedings at first instance) exceed 25% of the amount of the sum agreed or awarded in respect of-\n\n(a) general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity; and\n\n(b) damages for past financial loss\n\n(9) Except in a case to which Section IV, Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of Part 45 applies, and where a claim under rule 45.9 or 45.10 has not been made, no application may be made under this rule for a payment out of the money recovered by the child or protected party until the costs payable to the child or protected party have been assessed or agreed.\n\n(10) A litigation friend must support a claim for payment from a fund of costs or expenses by filing a witness statement setting out, so far as applicable-\n\n(a) the nature and amount of the costs or expenses and the reason they were incurred;\n\n(b) a copy of any conditional fee or damages based agreement;\n\n(c) a copy of any risk assessment by reference to which any success fee was determined;\n\n(d) the reasons why the particular funding model was selected;\n\n(e) the advice given to the litigation friend on funding arrangements;\n\n(f) a copy bill or informal breakdown of the solicitor and own client base costs incurred;\n\n(g) details of any costs agreed, recovered or fixed costs recoverable by the child; and\n\n(h) an explanation of the amount agreed or awarded for-\n\n(i) general damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity; and\n\n(ii) damages for past financial loss, net of any sums recoverable by the Compensation Recovery Unit or the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\n---\n\nAppointment of a guardian of a child's estate\n\n21.13\n\n(1) The court may appoint the Official Solicitor to be a guardian of a child's estate where -\n\n(a) money is paid into court on behalf of the child in accordance with directions given under rule 21.11 (control of money received by a child or protected party);\n\n(b) the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority notifies the court that it has made or intends to make an award to the child;\n\n(c) a court or tribunal outside England and Wales notifies the court that it has ordered or intends to order that money be paid to the child;\n\n(d) the child is absolutely entitled to the proceeds of a pension fund; or\n\n(e) in any other case, such an appointment seems desirable to the court.\n\n(2) The court may not appoint the Official Solicitor under this rule unless -\n\n(a) the persons with parental responsibility (within the meaning of section 3 of the Children Act 19892)agree; or\n\n(b) the court considers that their agreement can be dispensed with.\n\n(3) The Official Solicitor's appointment may continue only until the child reaches 18.\n\n(Paragraph 8 of Practice Direction 40 A deals with approval of the accounts of a guardian of assets of a child.)\n\n---\n\nFootnotes\n\n• 2007 c.15.

For the form of the statement of truth verifying an expert's report (which differs from that set out below) see Practice Direction 35.\n\n1.2 Where the form to be used includes a jurat for the content to be verified by an affidavit then a statement of truth is not required in addition.\n\n---\n\nForm of the statement of truth\n\n2.1 The form of the statement of truth verifying a statement of case, an application notice, a certificate of reasons or a notice of objections should be as follows:\n\n'[I believe][the (claimant or as may be) believes] that the facts stated in this [name document being verified] are true. [I understand] [The (claimant or as may be) understands] that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.'\n\n2.2 The form of the statement of truth verifying a witness statement should be as follows (and provided in the language of the witness statement):\n\n'I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true. I understand that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.'\n\n2.3 The form of the statement of truth verifying a costs budget should be as follows:\n\n'This budget is a fair and accurate statement of incurred and estimated costs which it would be reasonable and proportionate for my client to incur in this litigation.'\n\n2.4 The form of the certificate to be used under rule 22.1(9) where a person is unable to read or sign a document to be verified by a statement of truth should be as follows:\n\nI certify that I [name and address of authorised person] have read over the contents of this document and the declaration of truth to the person approving the document [if there are exhibits, add 'and explained the nature and effect of the exhibits referred to in it'] who appeared to understand (a) the document and approved its content as accurate and (b) the declaration of truth and the consequences of making a false declaration, and made their mark in my presence\n\n2.5 Where the statement of truth is contained in a separate document, the document containing the statement of truth must be headed with the title of the proceedings and the claim number. The document being verified should be identified in the statement of truth as follows:\n\n(1) claim form: 'the claim form issued on [date]',\n\n(2) particulars of claim: 'the particulars of claim issued on [date]',\n\n(3) statement of case: 'the [defence or as may be] served on the [name of party] on [date]',\n\n(4) application notice: 'the application notice issued on [date] for [set out the remedy sought]',\n\n(5) witness statement: 'the witness statement filed on [date] or served on [party] on [date]'.\n\n2.6 The statement of truth verifying a witness statement must be in the witness's own language.\n\n2.7 A statement of truth must be dated with the date on which it was signed.\n\n---\n\nWho may sign the statement of truth\n\n3.1 Where a document is to be verified on behalf of a company or other corporation, subject to paragraph 3.4 to 3.6 below, the statement of truth must be signed by a person holding a senior position 4 in the company or corporation. That person must state the office or position held.\n\n3.2 Each of the following persons is a person holding a senior position:\n\n(1) in respect of a registered company or corporation, a director, the treasurer, secretary, chief executive, manager or other officer of the company or corporation, and\n\n(2) in respect of a corporation which is not a registered company, in addition to the people set out in (1), the mayor, chair, president or town clerk or other similar officer of the corporation.\n\n3.3 Where the document is to be verified on behalf of a partnership, those who may sign the statement of truth are:\n\n(1) any of the partners, or\n\n(2) a person having the control or management of the partnership business.\n\n3.4 An insurer or the Motor Insurers' Bureau may sign a statement of truth in a statement of case on behalf of a party where the insurer or the Motor Insurers' Bureau has a financial interest in proceedings brought by or against that party. Paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 apply if the insurer is a company.\n\n3.5 If insurers are conducting proceedings on behalf of many claimants or defendants a statement of truth in a statement of case may be signed by a senior person responsible for the case at a lead insurer, but-\n\n(1) the person signing must specify the capacity in which they signs;\n\n(2) the statement of truth must be a statement that the lead insurer believes that the facts stated in the document are true; and\n\n(3) the court may order that a statement of truth also be signed by one or more of the parties.\n\n3.6 Where a party is legally represented, the legal representative may sign the statement of truth on their behalf. The statement signed by the legal representative will refer to the client's belief, not their own. They must state the capacity in which they sign and the name of their firm where appropriate.\n\n3.7 Where a legal representative has signed a statement of truth, their signature will be taken by the court as their statement that:\n\n(1) the client on whose behalf they have signed had authorised them to do so,\n\n(2) before signing they had explained to the client (through an interpreter where necessary) that in signing the statement of truth they would be confirming the client's belief that the facts stated in the document were true, and\n\n(3) before signing they had informed the client of the possible consequences to the client if it should later appear that the client did not have an honest belief in the truth of those facts (see rule 32.14).\n\n3.8 The individual who signs a statement of truth must print their full name clearly beneath their signature.\n\n3.9 A legal representative who signs a statement of truth must sign in their own name and not that of their firm or employer.\n\n3.10\n\n(1) A \"manager\" of a company should hold a senior position and have personal knowledge of the content of the document or be responsible for managing those who do. The court will consider the size and nature of the claim and of the company.\n\n(2) A \"legal representative\" is defined in rule 2.3(1). A person within that definition who is employed by a party may sign a statement of truth. A person employed by a party who is not within the definition but is managed by someone who is, may not.\n\n(3) An employee of a solicitor or firm of solicitors in private practice representing a party is within the definition of \"legal representative\" in rule 2.3(1) and may sign a statement of truth.\n\n(4) An agent who manages property or investments for a party cannot sign a statement of truth. It must be signed by the party or by the legal representative of the party.\n\n---\n\nFootnotes\n\n• See rule 22.1(3). • See Part 21 (Children and Protected Parties). • See rule 2.3 for the definition of legal representative. • Paragraph 6.2 of Practice Direction 6 A sets out the meaning of 'senior position'. • See rule 22.2(1).",

and\n\n(b)the application notice and evidence in support must be filed with the court on the day of the hearing or next working day or as ordered, together with two copies of the order for sealing where the application is made on paper.\n\n(Further information about the procedure for urgent applications, including urgent out of hours applications, may be found in the relevant court guide, on the HMCTS website, or by contacting the court directly.)\n\n---\n\nForm of order\n\n25.9.-(1) An order for an interim injunction must set out clearly what the respondent must do or not do.\n\n(2) An order for an interim injunction made in the presence of all parties to be bound by it or made at a hearing of which they have had notice, may state that it is effective until trial or further order.\n\n(3) Unless the court orders otherwise, an order for an interim injunction must contain-\n\n(a)subject to paragraph (6), an undertaking by the applicant to the court to pay any damages which the respondent sustains and which the court considers the applicant should pay;\n\n(b)if made without notice to any other party, an undertaking by the applicant to the court to serve on the respondent the application notice, evidence in support, note of the hearing and any order made as soon as practicable;\n\n(c)if made without notice to any other party, a return date for a further hearing at which the other party can be present;\n\n(d)if made before filing the application notice, an undertaking to file and pay the appropriate fee on the same or next working day; and\n\n(e)if made before issue of a claim form, an undertaking to issue and pay the appropriate fee on the same or next working day, or directions for the commencement of the claim.\n\n(4) When the court makes an order for delivery up or preservation of evidence or property which is likely to be executed at the premises of the respondent or a third party, it must consider whether to include provisions for the benefit or protection of those parties.\n\n(5) Subject to paragraph (6), when the court makes an order for an interim injunction, it must consider whether to require an undertaking by the applicant to pay any damages sustained by a person other than the respondent, including another party to the proceedings or any other person who may suffer loss as a consequence of the order.\n\n(6) In an Aarhus Convention claim to which rules 46.24 to 46.28 apply, if the court is satisfied that an interim injunction is necessary to prevent significant environmental damage and to preserve the factual basis of the proceedings, the court must, in considering whether to require an undertaking by the applicant, and the terms of any such undertaking-\n\n(a)have regard to the need for the terms of the order not to make continuing with the claim prohibitively expensive for the applicant; and\n\n(b)give such directions as are necessary to ensure that the case is heard promptly.\n\n(7) In this Section 'Aarhus Convention claim' has the same meaning as in rule 46.24(2).\n\n(8) Proceedings are 'prohibitively expensive' if their likely costs, including any court fees payable by the applicant and the amount of any cross-undertaking in damages, and having regard to any limit under Part 46 on a party's maximum costs liability, either exceed the financial resources of the applicant, or are objectively unreasonable having regard to the factors set out in rule 46.27(3)(b).\n\n(9) When a court considers the financial resources of the applicant, it must have regard to any financial support which any person has provided or is likely to provide to the applicant.\n\n---\n\nInterim injunction to cease if claim is stayed or automatically struck out\n\n25.10.-(1) If a claim is stayed other than by agreement between the parties, any interim injunction (other than a freezing injunction) granted in or in anticipation of the claim shall cease to have effect, unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(2) If a claim is automatically struck out, any interim injunction granted to the claimant in or in anticipation of the claim shall cease to have effect 14 days after the claim is struck out, unless the court orders otherwise or paragraph (3) applies.\n\n(3) If a claimant applies within 14 days to reinstate a claim that has been automatically struck out, any interim injunction granted to them in or in anticipation of the claim shall continue until the hearing of the application, unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(Rules 20.2 and 20.3 provide that counterclaims and other additional claims are treated as claims and that references to a claimant include a party bringing an additional claim.)\n\n---\n\nInjunctions against third parties\n\n25.11.-(1) The following provisions apply to orders which will affect a person, other than the applicant or respondent, who is served with the order but did not attend the hearing at which the order was made.\n\n(2) Where such a person requests-\n\n(a)a copy of any material provided to the judge, including material prepared after the hearing at the direction of the judge or in compliance with the order; or\n\n(b)a note of the hearing,\n\nthe applicant or their legal representative must comply with the request forthwith, unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n---\n\nSECTION III Freezing Injunctions\n\nScope\n\n25.12.This Section applies to applications for freezing injunctions.\n\nEvidence\n\n25.13.An application must be supported by evidence on affidavit or affirmation.\n\n---\n\nForm of order\n\n25.14.-(1) The applicant must use the wording of the model order in the form approved in accordance with rule 4(1), modified as appropriate.\n\n(2) Any modifications to the model order must be drawn to the judge's attention at the application hearing.\n\n(3) The court may, if it considers it appropriate, require the applicant's solicitors, as well as the applicant, to give undertakings.\n\nSECTION IV Search and Imaging Orders\n\n---\n\nScope\n\n25.15.This Section applies to applications for search orders, imaging orders, or both.\n\nSupervising Solicitor\n\n25.16.In this Section, 'Supervising Solicitor' means a solicitor experienced in the operation of search orders, who is not an employee or member of the applicant's firm of solicitors.\n\n---\n\nEvidence\n\n25.17.-(1) An application must be supported by evidence on affidavit or affirmation.\n\n(2) The affidavit or affirmation must-\n\n(a)state the address of the premises and whether it is a private or business address;\n\n(b)state the name, firm and its address, and experience of the Supervising Solicitor and, where an imaging order is sought, the independent IT expert; and\n\n(c)fully disclose the reason the order is sought, including the probability that relevant material would disappear if the order were not made.\n\n---\n\nForm of order\n\n25.18.-(1) The applicant must use the wording of the model search and imaging order in the form approved in accordance with rule 4(1), modified as appropriate.\n\n(2) Any modifications to the model order must be drawn to the judge's attention at the application hearing.\n\n(3) If the court orders that service by the Supervising Solicitor is not required, the reasons must be set out in the order.\n\n---\n\nService\n\n25.19.Unless the court otherwise orders, the order must be served personally by a Supervising Solicitor.\n\nSECTION VInterim Payment Orders\n\n---\n\nCourt's powers\n\n25.20.-(1) The court must not order an interim payment of more than a reasonable proportion of the likely amount of the final judgment.\n\n(2) The court must take into account contributory negligence and any relevant set-off or counterclaim.\n\n(3) The court may order an interim payment by instalments. If so, the order must set out-\n\n(a)the total amount of the payment;\n\n(b)the amount of each instalment;\n\n(c)the number of instalments and the date on which each is to be paid; and\n\n(d)to whom payment should be made.\n\n(4) Where a party seeks an interim payment and the court has ordered an account to be taken, if on the evidence the account is bound to result in a payment to the applicant, the court must, before making an order for interim payment, order that the liable party pay to the applicant the amount shown by the account to be due.\n\n(5) The permission of the court must be obtained before making a voluntary interim payment in respect of a claim by a child or protected party. 'Child' and 'protected party' have the same meanings as in rule 21.1(2).\n\n(6) The court may adjust any interim payment whether or not any payment has yet been made (voluntarily or under a previously made order). The court may in particular-\n\n(a)order all or part of the interim payment to be repaid;\n\n(b)vary or discharge the order for the interim payment;\n\n(c)order a defendant to reimburse, either wholly or partly, another defendant who has made an interim payment.\n\n(7) The court may make an order under paragraph (6)(c) only if-\n\n(a)the defendant to be reimbursed has claimed against the other defendant for a contribution, indemnity or other remedy; and\n\n(b)where the claim to which the interim payment relates has not been discontinued or disposed of, the circumstances are such that the court could make an interim payment order under this Section.\n\n(8) Where a defendant has made an interim payment, and the amount of the payment is more than their total liability under the final judgment or order, the court may award them interest on the overpaid amount from the date when they made the interim payment.\n\n(Practice Direction 40 B, paragraphs 6.1 to 6.4 provide further information concerning adjustment of the final judgment sum.)\n\n---\n\nApplications\n\n25.21.-(1) The claimant may not apply for an interim payment order before the end of the period for filing an acknowledgment of service applicable to the defendant against whom the application is made.\n\n(Rule 10.3 sets out the period for filing an acknowledgment of service.)\n\n(2) The claimant may make more than one application for an interim payment order.\n\n(3) A copy of the application notice must be served at least 14 days before the hearing of the application and must be supported by evidence.\n\n(4) If the respondent wishes to rely on written evidence at the hearing, they must file the written evidence and serve copies on every other party to the application at least 7 days before the hearing.\n\n(5) If the applicant wishes to rely on written evidence in reply, they must file the written evidence and serve a copy on the respondent at least 3 days before the hearing.\n\n(6) This rule does not require written evidence to be filed if it has already been filed, or to be served on a party on whom it has already been served.\n\n(7) The court may make an order under this rule without an application by any party if it makes the order when it disposes of the claim or any part of it.\n\n---\n\nEvidence\n\n25.22.-(1) An application for an interim payment order must be supported by evidence dealing with-\n\n(a)the sum of money sought by way of an interim payment;\n\n(b)the items or matters in respect of which the interim payment is sought;\n\n(c)the sum of money for which final judgment is likely to be given;\n\n(d)the reasons for believing that the conditions set out in rule 25.23 are satisfied;\n\n(e)any other relevant matters;\n\n(f)in claims for personal injuries, details of special damages and past and future loss; and\n\n(g)in a claim under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976(4), details of the person(s) on whose behalf the claim is made and the nature of the claim.\n\n(2) Any documents in support of the application must be exhibited, including, in personal injuries claims, any medical report.\n\n---\n\nConditions to be satisfied\n\n25.23.The court may only make an interim payment order where any of the following conditions are satisfied-\n\n(a)the defendant against whom the order is sought has admitted liability to pay damages or another sum of money to the claimant;\n\n(b)the claimant has obtained judgment against that defendant for damages to be assessed, or for another sum of money (other than costs) to be assessed;\n\n(c)it is satisfied that, if the claim went to trial, the claimant would obtain judgment for a substantial amount of money (other than costs) against the defendant from whom they are seeking an interim payment, whether or not that defendant is the only defendant or one of several;\n\n(e)the claimant is seeking an order for possession of land (whether or not any other order is also sought), and the court is satisfied that, if the case went to trial, the defendant would be held liable (even if the claim for possession fails) to pay the claimant a sum of money for the defendant's occupation and use of the land while the claim for possession was pending; or\n\n(f)there are two or more defendants and the order is sought against any one or more of them, and-\n\n(i)the court is satisfied that, if the claim went to trial, the claimant would obtain judgment for a substantial amount of money (other than costs) against at least one of the defendants (but the court cannot determine which); and\n\n(ii)all the defendants are either public bodies; or insured in respect of the claim; or are defendants whose liability will be met by an insurer under section 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1988(5), or an insurer acting under the Motor Insurers Bureau Agreement, or the Motor Insurers Bureau where it is acting itself.\n\n---\n\nCompensation recovery payments\n\n25.24.-(1) Where in a claim for personal injuries there is a contested application for interim payment of damages, the defendant must obtain a certificate from the Secretary of State (as defined in rule 36.20(1)(e)) where the claim-\n\n(a)falls under the heads of damage set out in column 1 of Schedule 2 to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997(6) ('the 1997 Act') in respect of recoverable benefits received by the claimant set out in column 2 of that Schedule, or includes damages in respect of a disease for which a lump sum payment within the definition in section 1 A(2) of the 1997 Act has been, or is likely to be made; and\n\n(b)the defendant is liable to pay a recoverable amount (as defined in rule 36.20(1)(c)) to the Secretary of State.\n\n(2) A copy of the certificate must be filed at the hearing of the application.\n\n(3) The order must set out the deductible amount (as defined in rule 36.20(1)(d)).\n\n(4) The payment made to the claimant must be the net amount but for the purpose of calculating the payment after the final judgment, the gross amount of the interim payment must be used.\n\n---\n\nRestriction on disclosure\n\n25.25.The fact that a defendant has made an interim payment, whether voluntarily or by court order, shall not be disclosed to the trial judge until all questions of liability and the amount of money to be awarded have been decided, unless that defendant agrees.\n\nSECTION VI Security for Costs\n\n---\n\nApplications\n\n25.26.-(1) A defendant to any claim may apply for security for their costs of the proceedings.\n\n(Part 3 provides for the court to order payment of sums into court in other circumstances. Rule 20.3 provides for this Section to apply to counterclaims or other additional claims.)\n\n(2) An application for security for costs must be supported by written evidence.\n\n(3) Where the court makes an order for security for costs, it must determine the amount of security, and direct the manner and time within which the security must be given.\n\n---\n\nConditions to be satisfied\n\n25.27.The court may make an order for security for costs if-\n\n(a)it is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that it is just to make such an order; and\n\n(b)either an enactment permits the court to require security for costs, or one or more of the following conditions apply-\n\n(i)the claimant is resident out of the jurisdiction;\n\n(ii)the claimant is a company or other body (whether incorporated inside or outside England and Wales) and there is reason to believe that it will be unable to pay the defendant's costs if ordered to do so;\n\n(iii)the claimant has changed their address since the claim was commenced with a view to evading the consequences of the litigation;\n\n(iv)the claimant failed to give their address in the claim form, or gave an incorrect address;\n\n(v)the claimant is acting as a nominal claimant, other than as a representative claimant under Part 19, and there is reason to believe that they will be unable to pay the defendant's costs if ordered to do so;\n\n(vi)the claimant has taken steps in relation to their assets that would make it difficult to enforce an order for costs against them.\n\n---\n\nSecurity for costs other than from the claimant\n\n25.28.The defendant may seek a security for costs order against a person other than the claimant, and the court may make such an order, if-\n\n(a)the court is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that it is just to make such an order;\n\n(b)the person has assigned the right to the claim to the claimant with a view to avoiding the possibility of a costs order being made against them, or has contributed or agreed to contribute to the claimant's costs in return for a share of any recovery in the proceedings; and\n\n(c)the person is someone against whom a costs order may be made.\n\n---\n\nSecurity for costs of an appeal\n\n25.29.-(1) The court may order security for costs of an appeal against an appellant, or a respondent who also appeals, on the same grounds as it may order security for costs against a claimant.\n\n(2) The court may also make such an order where the appellant, or the respondent who also appeals, is a limited company and there is reason to believe it will be unable to pay the costs of the other parties to the appeal should its appeal be unsuccessful.",

Part 27 makes provision for the small claims track. Part 28 makes provision for the fast track and the intermediate track. Part 29 makes provision for the multi-track.)\n\n---\n\nAutomatic transfer in the High Court\n\n26.2.-(1) This rule applies to proceedings in the High Court where-\n\n(a)the claim is for a specified amount of money;\n\n(b)the claim was commenced in a court which is not the defendant's home court;\n\n(c)the claim has not been transferred to another defendant's home court; and\n\n(d)the defendant is an individual.\n\n(2) This rule does not apply where the claim was commenced in a specialist list.\n\n(3) Where this rule applies, the court shall transfer the proceedings to the defendant's home court when a defence is filed, unless paragraph (4) applies.\n\n(Rule 2.3 defines 'defendant's home court'.)\n\n(4) Where the claimant notifies the court under rule 15.10 that they wish the proceedings to continue, the court shall transfer the proceedings to the defendant's home court when it receives that notification from the claimant.\n\n(Rule 15.10 deals with a claimant's notice where the defence is that money claimed has been paid)\n\n(5) Where-\n\n(a)the claim is against two or more defendants with different home courts; and\n\n(b)the defendant whose defence is filed first is an individual,\n\nproceedings are to be transferred under this rule to the home court of that defendant.\n\n(6) The time when a claim is automatically transferred under this rule may be varied by a practice direction in respect of claims issued by the Production Centre.\n\n(Rule 7.10 makes provision for the Production Centre.)\n\n---\n\nTransfer of money claims within the County Court\n\n26.3.-(1) This rule applies where the claim is for an amount of money in the County Court, specified or unspecified.\n\n(2) If at any time a court officer considers that the claim should be referred to a judge for directions, the court officer may send the proceedings to the defendant's home court or the preferred hearing centre or other County Court hearing centre as may be appropriate.\n\n(3) Subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), if the defendant is an individual and the claim is for a specified sum of money, at the relevant time the claim must be sent to the defendant's home court (save that where there are two or more defendants, one or more of whom are individuals, the claim must be sent to the home court of the defendant who first files their defence).\n\n(4) Subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), in any other claim to which this rule applies, the court must, at the relevant time, send the claim to the preferred hearing centre.\n\n(5) Subject to paragraph (6), if, on their directions questionnaire-\n\n(a)a defendant under paragraph (3) has specified a hearing centre other than the defendant's home court; or\n\n(b)a claimant under paragraph (4) has specified a hearing centre other than the preferred hearing centre,\n\nthe claim must be sent to that other hearing centre.\n\n(6) At the relevant time, the claim must be sent to the County Court at Central London if-\n\n(a)the claim is started at the Civil National Business Centre;\n\n(b)a court officer provisionally decides, pursuant to rule 26.4, that the track which appears to be most suitable for the claim is the multi-track; and\n\n(c)either-\n\n(i)in respect of a defendant under paragraphs (3) and (5)(a), the home court (or the home court of the defendant who first files their defence) or the hearing centre specified on the directions questionnaire; or\n\n(ii)in respect of a claimant under paragraphs (4) and (5)(b), the preferred hearing centre or the hearing centre specified on the directions questionnaire,\n\nis one of the hearing centres listed in Practice Direction 26 at paragraph 19.\n\n(7) The relevant time for the purposes of this rule is when-\n\n(a)all parties have filed their directions questionnaires;\n\n(b)any stay ordered by the court or period to attempt settlement through mediation has expired; or\n\n(c)if the claim falls within Practice Direction 49 D-\n\n(i)the defence is filed; or\n\n(ii)enforcement of a default judgment other than by a warrant of control is requested,\n\nwhichever occurs first.\n\n---\n\nDirections questionnaire\n\n26.4.-(1) Subject to rule 26.8, if a defendant files a defence-\n\n(a)a court officer shall-\n\n(i)provisionally decide the track which appears to be most suitable for the claim; and\n\n(ii)serve on each party a notice of proposed allocation; and\n\n(b)the notice of proposed allocation shall-\n\n(i)specify any matter to be complied with by the date specified in the notice;\n\n(ii)require the parties to file a completed directions questionnaire and serve copies on all other parties;\n\n(iii)state the address of the court or the court office to which the directions questionnaire must be returned;\n\n(iv)inform the parties how to obtain the directions questionnaire; and\n\n(v)if a case appears suitable for allocation to the fast track, intermediate track or multi-track, require the parties to file proposed directions by the date specified in the notice.\n\n(2) The court shall serve on any unrepresented party the appropriate directions questionnaire.\n\n(3) Where there are two or more defendants and at least one of them files a defence, the court shall serve the notice under paragraph (1)-\n\n(a)when all the defendants have filed a defence; or\n\n(b)when the period for the filing of the last defence has expired,\n\nwhichever is the sooner.\n\n(Rule 15.4 specifies the period for filing a defence.)\n\n(4) If proceedings are automatically transferred under rule 26.2 or rule 26.3 the court in which the proceedings have been commenced-\n\n(a)shall serve the notice of proposed allocation before the proceedings are transferred; and\n\n(b)shall not transfer the proceedings until all parties have complied with the notice or the time for doing so has expired.\n\n(5) If rule 15.10 applies, the court shall not serve a notice under rule 26.4(1) until the claimant has filed a notice requiring the proceedings to continue.\n\n(6) If a notice is served under paragraph (1)-\n\n(a)each party must file, and serve on all other parties, the documents required by the notice by no later than the date specified in it; and\n\n(b)the date specified must be-\n\n(i)if the notice relates to the small claims track, at least 14 days; or\n\n(ii)if the notice relates to the fast track, intermediate track, or multi-track, at least 28 days,\n\nafter the date when it is deemed to be served on the party in question.\n\n(7) The date for complying with a notice served under paragraph (1) may not be varied by agreement between the parties.\n\n(8) The time when the court serves a directions questionnaire under this rule may be varied by a practice direction in respect of claims issued by the Production Centre.\n\n(9) If a claim is a claim to which rule 26.3 applies and a party does not comply with the notice served under paragraph (1) by the date specified-\n\n(a)the court shall serve a further notice on that party, requiring them to comply within 7 days; and\n\n(b)if that party fails to comply with the notice served under sub-paragraph (a), the party's statement of case shall be struck out without further order of the court.\n\n(10) If a claim is a claim to which rule 26.2 applies and a party does not comply with the notice served under paragraph (1) by the date specified, the court may make such order as it considers appropriate, including-\n\n(a)an order for directions;\n\n(b)an order striking out the claim;\n\n(c)an order striking out the defence and entering judgment; or\n\n(d)listing the case for a case management conference.\n\n(11) Where a case has been struck out under paragraph (9)(b) or an order has been made under paragraph (10), a party who was in default shall, unless the court thinks it unjust to do so, be ordered to pay the costs that the default caused to any other party.\n\n(Rule 7.10 makes provision for the Production Centre.)\n\n(Rules 6.14 and 6.26 specify when a document is deemed to be served.)\n\n---\n\nStay to allow for settlement of the case\n\n26.5.-(1) A party may, when filing the completed directions questionnaire, make a written request for the proceedings to be stayed while the parties try to settle the case by alternative dispute resolution or other means.\n\n(2) If all parties request a stay the proceedings shall be stayed for one month and the court shall notify the parties accordingly.\n\n(3) If the court otherwise considers that such a stay would be appropriate, the court may direct that the proceedings, either in whole or in part, be stayed for one month, or for such other period as it considers appropriate.\n\n(4) The court may extend the stay until such date or for such specified period as it considers appropriate.\n\n(5) Where the court stays the proceedings under this rule, the claimant must tell the court if a settlement is reached.\n\n(6) If the claimant does not tell the court by the end of the period of the stay that a settlement has been reached, the court shall give such directions as to the management of the case as it considers appropriate.\n\n---\n\nReferral to the Mediation Service\n\n26.6.-(1) This rule applies to claims started in the County Court which would normally be allocated to the small claims track pursuant to rule 26.9.\n\n(2) This rule does not apply to-\n\n(a)road traffic accident, personal injury or housing disrepair claims; or\n\n(b)any claim in which any party to the proceedings does not agree to referral to the Mediation Service.\n\n(3) In this rule, 'the Mediation Service' means the Small Claims Mediation Service operated by His Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service.\n\n(4) Where all parties indicate on their directions questionnaire that they agree to mediation, the claim shall be referred to the Mediation Service.\n\n(5) If a claim to which this rule applies is settled, the proceedings shall automatically be stayed with permission to apply for-\n\n(a)judgment for the unpaid balance of the outstanding sum of the settlement agreement; or\n\n(b)the claim to be restored for hearing of the full amount claimed,\n\nunless the parties have agreed that the claim is to be discontinued or dismissed.\n\n---\n\nAllocation and assignment\n\n26.7.-(1) Subject to rule 26.8, the court shall allocate the claim to a track and, where applicable, assign it to a complexity band-\n\n(a)after all parties have filed their directions questionnaires; or\n\n(b)when giving directions pursuant to rule 26.4(10),\n\nunless it has stayed the proceedings under rule 26.5.\n\n(2) If the court has stayed the proceedings under rule 26.5, it shall allocate the claim to a track and, where applicable, assign it to a complexity band at the end of the period of the stay.\n\n(3) If-\n\n(a)a claim is referred to the Mediation Service pursuant to rule 26.6; and\n\n(b)the court has not been notified in writing that a settlement has been agreed,\n\nthe claim shall be allocated to a track and, where applicable, assigned to a complexity band in accordance with this rule no later than four weeks from the date on which the last directions questionnaire is filed.\n\n(4) Before deciding the track to which to allocate or the complexity band to which to assign proceedings, or deciding whether to give directions for an allocation hearing or an assignment hearing to be fixed, the court may order a party to provide further information about his case.\n\n(5) The court may hold an allocation hearing or an assignment hearing if it thinks it is necessary.\n\n(6) If a party fails to file a directions questionnaire, the court may give any direction it considers appropriate.\n\n(7) When, in a claim to which Section VI or Section VII of Part 45 applies, the court decides the track to which a claim should be allocated or the complexity band to which it should be assigned-\n\n(a)it shall also consider whether it is in the interests of justice to order that rule 45.5(4) should apply to that claim; and\n\n(b)when considering whether it is in the interests of justice to make such an order, it shall have regard to whether the claim of each claimant arises from the same or substantially the same facts and gives rise to the same or substantially the same issues.\n\n---\n\nProceedings under Practice Direction 27 B\n\n26.8.-(1) This rule applies where-\n\n(a)the parties have followed the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents; and\n\n(b)proceedings have been started under Practice Direction 27 B.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraph (3), where this rule applies, the claim shall be treated as allocated to the small claims track when it is issued and rules 26.4, 26.5 and 26.7 shall not apply.\n\n(3) Where in any claim started or continued under Practice Direction 27 B-\n\n(a)the appropriate court form states that-\n\n(i)the amount claimed is more than £10,000; or\n\n(ii)the claim for personal injury damages is more than £5,000; or\n\n(b)rule 26.10 applies,\n\na court officer must refer the claim to a judge for allocation to a track and to give directions.\n\n---\n\nScope of each track\n\n26.9.-(1) The small claims track is the normal track for-\n\n(a)any claim for personal injuries where-\n\n(i)the value of the claim is not more than £10,000; and\n\n(ii)the value of any claim for damages for personal injuries is not more than-\n\n(aa)£5,000 in a claim for personal injuries arising from a road traffic accident, except as provided in sub-paragraph (bb);\n\n(bb)£1,000 in a claim for personal injuries arising from a road traffic accident, in any of the circumstances specified in rule 26.10; or\n\n(cc)£1,500 in any other claim for personal injuries.\n\n(b)any claim which includes a claim by a tenant of residential premises against a landlord where-\n\n(i)the tenant is seeking an order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs or other work to the premises (whether or not the tenant is also seeking some other remedy);\n\n(ii)the cost of the repairs or other work to the premises is estimated to be not more than £1,000; and\n\n(iii)the value of any other claim for damages is not more than £1,000; and\n\n(c)in relation to claims under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016(1), any claim which includes a claim by a contract-holder of a dwelling against a landlord where-\n\n(i)the contract holder is seeking an order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs or other work to the dwelling (whether or not the contract-holder is also seeking some other remedy);\n\n(ii)the cost of repairs or other work to the dwelling is estimated to be not more than £1,000; and\n\n(iii)the value of any other claim for damages is not more than £1,000.\n\n(Rule 2.3 defines 'claim for personal injuries' as proceedings in which there is a claim for damages in respect of personal injuries to the claimant or any other person or in respect of a person's death.)\n\n(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) 'damages for personal injuries' means damages claimed as compensation for pain, suffering and loss of amenity and does not include any other damages which are claimed.\n\n(3) 'Road traffic accident' means an accident resulting in a bodily injury to any person caused by, or arising out of, the use of a motor vehicle on a road or other public place in England and Wales unless the injury was caused wholly or in part by a breach by the defendant of one or more of the relevant statutory provisions as defined by section 53 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974(2).\n\n(4) Subject to paragraph (1), the small claims track is the normal track for any claim which has a value of not more than £10,000.\n\n(Rule 26.12(2) and (3) provides that the court must not allocate to the small claims track certain claims in respect of harassment or unlawful eviction.)\n\n(5) Subject to paragraphs (6) and (10), the fast track is the normal track for any claim-\n\n(a)for which the small claims track is not the normal track; and\n\n(b)which-\n\n(i)is a claim for monetary relief, the value of which is not more than £25,000; or\n\n(ii)is or includes a claim for non-monetary relief and-\n\n(aa)if the claim includes a claim for monetary relief, the value of the claim for monetary relief is not more than £25,000;\n\n(bb)the claim meets the criteria in paragraph (6)(a) and (b); and\n\n(cc)the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for it to be allocated to the fast track.\n\n(6) The fast track is the normal track for the claims referred to in paragraph (5) only if the court considers that-\n\n(a)the trial is likely to last for no longer than one day; and\n\n(b)oral expert evidence at trial is likely to be limited to-\n\n(i)one expert per party in relation to any expert field; and\n\n(ii)expert evidence in two expert fields.\n\n(7) Subject to paragraphs (8), (9) and (10), the intermediate track is the normal track where-\n\n(a)the claim is suitable for neither the small claims track nor the fast track;\n\n(b)the claim includes a claim for monetary relief, the value of which is not more than £100,000;\n\n(c)the court considers that-\n\n(i)if the case is managed proportionately, the trial will not last longer than three days;\n\n(ii)oral expert evidence at trial is likely to be limited to two experts per party;\n\n(iii)the claim may be justly and proportionately managed under the procedure set out in Section IV of Part 28; and\n\n(iv)there are no additional factors, which would make the claim inappropriate for the intermediate track; and\n\n(d)the claim is brought by one claimant against either one or two defendants, or is brought by two claimants against one defendant.\n\n(8) Where the relief sought includes a claim for non-monetary relief, the claim shall not be allocated to the intermediate track unless the court also considers it to be in the interests of justice to do so.\n\n(9) Subject to paragraph (10), the court may allocate a claim to the intermediate track where it considers it to be in the interests of justice to do so.\n\n(10) A claim must be allocated to the multi-track where that claim is-\n\n(a)a mesothelioma claim or asbestos lung disease claim;\n\n(b)one which includes a claim for clinical negligence, unless-\n\n(i)the claim is one which would normally be allocated to the intermediate track;\n\n(ii)there has been an admission of liability in full, which means that the defendant accepts that the claimant has suffered loss, including the injury set out in the letter of claim under the Pre-Action Protocol for the Resolution of Clinical Disputes, caused by the defendant's breach of duty of care; and\n\n(iii)the admission in paragraph (ii) is made in the defendant's letter of response provided in accordance with the Pre-Action Protocol for the Resolution of Clinical Disputes,\n\nprovided that the defendant has not raised a defence to the claim under the Limitation Act 1980;\n\n(c)a claim for damages in relation to harm, abuse or neglect of or by children or vulnerable adults;\n\n(d)a claim is one the court could order to be tried by jury if satisfied that there is in issue a matter set out in section 66(3) of the County Courts Act 1984(3) or section 69(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981(4);\n\n(e)a claim against the police which includes a claim for-\n\n(i)an intentional or reckless tort; or\n\n(ii)relief or a remedy in relation to a breach of the Human Rights Act 1998(5); or\n\n(f)a claim against a public authority for trespass to the person, unless, having regard to the matters mentioned in rule 26.13(1), the court considers that it would not be in the interests of justice to do so.\n\n(11) Paragraph (10)(e) does not apply to-\n\n(a)a road accident claim arising from negligent police driving;\n\n(b)an employer's liability claim;\n\n(c)any other claim for an accidental fall on police premises.\n\n(12) The multi-track is the normal track for any claim for which the small claims track or the fast track or the intermediate track is not the normal track.\n\n---\n\nRoad traffic accident related personal injury claims\n\n26.10.The circumstances referred to in rule 26.9(1)(a)(ii)(bb) are-\n\n(a)the accident occurred before 31 st May 2021;\n\n(b)unless rule 26.11 applies, on the date that proceedings are started, the claimant is-\n\n(i)a child; or\n\n(ii)a protected party;\n\n(c)when the accident occurred, the claimant was-\n\n(i)using a motor cycle;\n\n(ii)a pillion passenger on, or a passenger in a sidecar attached to, a motor cycle;\n\n(iii)using a wheelchair, a powered wheelchair or a mobility scooter;\n\n(iv)using a bicycle or other pedal cycle;\n\n(v)riding a horse; or\n\n(vi)a pedestrian;\n\n(d)unless rule 26.11 applies, on the date that proceedings are started-\n\n(i)the claimant is an undischarged bankrupt; or\n\n(ii)the claimant or defendant acts as a personal representative of a deceased person; or\n\n(e)unless rule 26.11 applies, on the date of the accident, the defendant's vehicle was registered outside the United Kingdom.\n\n---\n\nChildren and protected parties\n\n26.11.-(1) The fast track is the normal track where a claim-\n\n(a)is for personal injuries arising from a road traffic accident which occurs on or after 31 st May 2021;\n\n(b)is made by-\n\n(i)a child or a protected party; or\n\n(ii)a person who, on the date the claim was first presented via the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents, was a child; and\n\n(c)consists of, or includes, a claim for a whiplash injury.\n\n(2) Where this rule applies, the claim must not be allocated to the small claims track.\n\n(3) 'Whiplash injury' has the meaning ascribed to it by paragraph 1.2(38) of the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents.\n\n---\n\nAllocation - general\n\n26.12.-(1) In considering whether to allocate a claim to the normal track for that claim under rules 26.9, 26.10 or 26.11, the court shall have regard to the matters mentioned in rule 26.13(1).\n\n(2) The court must not allocate a claim to the small claims track, if it includes a claim by a tenant of residential premises against his landlord for a remedy in respect of harassment or unlawful eviction.\n\n(3) In claims under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, the court must not allocate a claim to the small claims track if it includes a claim by a contract-holder of a dwelling against their landlord for a remedy in respect of harassment or unlawful eviction.\n\n---\n\nMatters relevant to allocation to a track\n\n26.13.-(1) When deciding the track for a claim, the matters to which the court shall have regard include-\n\n(a)the financial value, if any, of the claim;\n\n(b)the nature of the remedy sought;\n\n(c)the likely complexity of the facts, law or evidence;\n\n(d)the number of parties or likely parties;\n\n(e)the value of any counterclaim or additional claim and the complexity of any matters relating to it;\n\n(f)the amount of oral evidence which may be required;\n\n(g)the importance of the claim to persons who are not parties to the proceedings;\n\n(h)the views expressed by the parties; and\n\n(i)the circumstances of the parties.\n\n(2) It is for the court to assess the financial value of a claim and in doing so it shall disregard-\n\n(a)any amount not in dispute;\n\n(b)any claim for interest;\n\n(c)costs;\n\n(d)any contributory negligence; and\n\n(e)where the claim is, or includes a claim for non-monetary relief, any amount prescribed by rule 45.45(1)(a)(ii) and rule 45.50(2)(b)(ii).\n\n(3) Where-\n\n(a)two or more claimants have started a claim against the same defendant using the same claim form; and\n\n(b)each claimant has a claim against the defendant separate from the other claimants,\n\nthe court shall consider the claim of each claimant separately when it assesses financial value under paragraph (1).\n\n---\n\nAssignment within the fast track and the intermediate track\n\n26.14.-(1) When a claim is allocated to the fast track or the intermediate track, the court must also assign the claim to a complexity band, unless it is one to which Section VIII of Part 45 applies.\n\n(2) In both Table 1 and Table 2, below, the complexity bands numbered 1 to 4 provide an ascending scale of allowable costs commensurate with the complexity of the claim.\n\n(3) The complexity band to which a claim is assigned shall determine the costs that are to be allowed under Table 12 or Table 14 in Practice Direction 45.\n\n(4) Subject to paragraph (5), the parties may agree the complexity band to which a claim is assigned.\n\n(5) The court may direct that a claim be assigned to a different complexity band than that agreed by the parties, but shall have regard to the factors set out in rule 26.13(1).\n\n(6) A party must state on their directions questionnaire-\n\n(a)the agreed complexity band; or\n\n(b)where the parties disagree, the complexity band considered appropriate by that party,\n\ntogether with any relevant information in support.\n\n---\n\nAssignment within the fast track\n\n26.15.Unless the claim is one for noise induced hearing loss (in respect of which Sections I and IV of Part 28 and Section VIII of Part 45 make provision), the complexity band to which a claim will normally be assigned in the fast track is set out in Table 1.\n\nTable 1\n\n(a) road traffic accident related, non-personal injury claims; and\n\n(a) road traffic accident related, personal injury claims which are or should have been started under the RTA Protocol; and\n\n(a) road traffic accident related, personal injury claims to which the RTA Protocol does not apply;\n\n(a) employer's liability disease claims (other than a claim for noise induced hearing loss);\n\n(b) defended debt claims\n\n(b) personal injury claims to which the Pre-action Protocol for Resolution of Package Travel Claims apply\n\n(b) employer's liability (accident) and public liability personal injury claims;\n\n(b) complex possession and housing disrepair claims;\n\n(c) possession claims;\n\n(c) property and building disputes;\n\n(d) housing disrepair claims; and\n\n(d) professional negligence claims; and\n\n(e) other claims for a sum of money, whether the sum is specified or unspecified, except claims that fall under complexity band 1(b)\n\n(e) any claim which would normally be allocated to the fast track, but is nonetheless complex\n\n---\n\nAssignment within the intermediate track\n\n26.16.The complexity band to which a claim will normally be assigned in the intermediate track is set out in Table 2.\n\nTable 2\n\nAny claim where-\n\n(a) only one issue is in dispute; and\n\nAny more complex claim where more than one issue is in dispute, but which is unsuitable for assignment to complexity band 2, including noise induced hearing loss and other employer's liability disease claims.\n\nAny claim which would normally be allocated to the intermediate track, but which is unsuitable for assignment to complexity bands 1 to 3, including any personal injury claim where there are serious issues of fact or law.\n\n(b) the trial is not expected to last longer than one day, including-\n\n(i) personal injury claims where liability or quantum is in dispute;\n\n(ii) road traffic accident related, non-personal injury claims; and\n\n---\n\nNotice of allocation and assignment\n\n26.17. When it has allocated a claim to a track, the court shall serve notice of allocation and, where applicable, assignment on every party.\n\n---\n\nReallocation and reassignment\n\n26.18.-(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the court may on application or on its own initiative subsequently-\n\n(a)reallocate a claim to a different track; or\n\n(b)reassign a claim to a different complexity band.\n\n(2) Where-\n\n(a)a claim is allocated to the intermediate track; and\n\n(b)directions in respect of that claim have been given,\n\nthe court may only reallocate the claim where it decides that there are exceptional reasons to justify doing so.\n\n(3) The court may only reassign a claim to a different complexity band, where-\n\n(a)there has been a change in circumstances since a direction was made assigning the claim to a particular complexity band; and\n\n(b)the court decides the change in circumstances justifies reassignment.\n\n---\n\nTrial with a jury\n\n26.19.-(1) An application for a claim, other than a claim for libel and slander, to be tried with a jury must be made within 28 days of service of the defence.\n\n(2) A claim for libel or slander must be tried by Judge alone, unless at the first case management conference a party applies for trial with a jury and the court makes an order to that effect.\n\n---\n\nFootnotes\n\n(1)2016 anaw 1.\n\n(2)1974 c. 37.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 26 - CASE MANAGEMENT - PRELIMINARY STAGE: ALLOCATION, REALLOCATION, ASSIGNMENT AND REASSIGNMENT\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Part 26\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nReminders of important rule provisions other than Parts 26 to 29\n\n(1)Attention is drawn in particular to the following provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules-\n\n(a) Part 1\n\n(i) the Overriding Objective (defined in Rule 1.1);\n\n(ii) the duty of the court to further that objective by actively managing cases (set out in Rule 1.4);\n\n(iii) requirement that the parties help the court to further that objective (set out in Rule 1.3);\n\n(b) Section I of Part 3\n\nThe court's case management powers (which may be exercised on application or on its own initiative) and the sanctions which it may impose.\n\n(c) Part 24\n\nThe court's power to grant summary judgment.\n\n(d) Parts 32 to 35\n\nEvidence, especially the court's power to control evidence.\n\n(2)Attention is also drawn to the practice directions which supplement those Parts and Parts 27 to 29, and to those which relate to the various specialist jurisdictions.\n\n---\n\nThe directions questionnaire\n\n(1) The notice of proposed allocation referred to in rule 26.4(1) will be-\n\n(a) in the small claims track, in form N 149 A (SCT);\n\n(b) in the fast track, in form N 149 B (FT);\n\n(c) in the intermediate track, in form N 149 D (IT); and\n\n(d) in the multi-track, in form N 149 C (MT),\n\nand the directions questionnaire referred to in Part 26 will be in Forms N 180 and N 181.\n\n(2) Attention is drawn to Part 3 of the Civil Procedure Rules which requires costs budgets in all multi-track cases.\n\n---\n\nProvision of extra information\n\n(1) If a party wishes to give the court further information which is believed to be relevant to allocation, assignment to a complexity band, where applicable, or case management it shall be given when the party files the directions questionnaire and copied to all other parties.\n\n(2) The general rule is that the court will not take such information into account unless the document containing it either-\n\n(a) confirms that all parties have agreed that the information is correct and that it should be put before the court; or\n\n(b) confirms that the party who has sent the document to the court has delivered a copy to all the other parties.\n\n(3) The following are examples of information which will be likely to help the court-\n\n(a) a party's intention to apply for summary judgment or some other order that may dispose of the case or reduce the amount in dispute or the number of issues remaining to be decided;\n\n(b) a party's intention to issue an additional claim or to add another party;\n\n(c) the steps the parties have taken in the preparation of evidence (in particular expert evidence), the steps they intend to take and whether those steps are to be taken in co-operation with any other party;\n\n(d) the directions the party believes will be appropriate to be given for the management of the case;\n\n(e) about any particular facts that may affect the timetable the court will set;\n\n(f) any facts which may make it desirable for the court to fix an allocation hearing, an assignment hearing, where applicable, or a hearing at which case management directions will be given.\n\n---\n\nConsultation\n\n(1) The parties must consult one another and co-operate in completing the directions questionnaires and giving other information to the court.\n\n(2) The parties must try to agree the case management directions which they will invite the court to make. Further details appear in the practice directions which supplement Parts 28 and 29.\n\n(Specimen directions for a case which is allocated to the multi-track are available on the Justice website at:www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil)\n\n(3) The process of consultation must not delay the filing of the directions questionnaire or, where required, the proposed directions (whether or not agreed).\n\n(4) The court will expect the parties to have considered the track to which the claim should be allocated if proceedings are started, and, where applicable, the complexity band to which it should be assigned, having regard to the provisions in rules 26.9, 26.13 to 26.16.\n\n---\n\nHearings before allocation\n\n5.Where a court hearing takes place (for example on an application for an interim injunction or for summary judgment under Part 24) before the claim is allocated to a track, the court may at that hearing-\n\n(a) dispense with the need for the parties to file directions questionnaires, treat the hearing as an allocation hearing or, if applicable, an assignment hearing, make an order for allocation and assignment and give directions for case management; and\n\n(b) fix a date for directions questionnaires to be filed and give other directions.\n\n---\n\nConsequences of failure to file a directions questionnaire\n\n(1) Parties must comply with the notice served under rule 26.4(1) by the date specified in it. Rules 26.4(9), which concerns claims started in the County Court for specified and unspecified amounts of money, and 26.4(10), which concerns claims other than those claims started in the County Court for specified and unspecified amounts of money, apply where a party is in default.\n\n(2) Under rule 26.4(10) the court may give directions of its own initiative or list the case for a case management conference. Alternatively, if it appears appropriate to do so, the claim may be struck out or, where a defendant is in default, judgment may be entered against that defendant.\n\n(3) Rule 26.4(11) provides for a costs sanction if an order is made under either rules 26.4(9)(b) or 26.4(10).\n\n---\n\nStay to allow for settlement of the case\n\n(1)\n\n(a) The court will generally accept a letter from any party or from the solicitor for any party as an application to extend the stay under rule 26.5.\n\n(b) The letter should-\n\n(i) confirm that the application is made with the agreement of all parties; and\n\n(ii) explain the steps being taken and identify any mediator or expert assisting with the process.\n\n(2)\n\n(a) subject to Practice Direction 2 E, an order extending the stay must be made by a judge;\n\n(b) the extension will generally be for no more than 4 weeks unless clear reasons are given to justify a longer time.\n\n(3) More than one extension of the stay may be granted.\n\n(4) At the end of the stay the file will be referred to a judge for directions.\n\n(5) The judge will consider whether to allocate the claim to a track and what other directions to give, or may require any party to give further information or fix an allocation hearing or, where applicable, an assignment hearing.\n\n(6) Any party may apply for a stay to be lifted.\n\n(7) Where the whole of the proceedings are settled during a stay, the taking of any of the following steps will be treated as an application for the stay to be lifted-\n\n(a) an application for a consent order (in any form) to give effect to the settlement;\n\n(b) an application for the approval of a settlement where a party is a person under a disability; or\n\n(c) giving notice of acceptance of money paid into court in satisfaction of the claim or applying for money in court to be paid out.\n\n---\n\nSmall claims mediation\n\n8.If a claim is referred to the Mediation Service pursuant to rule 26.6 or at the court's direction, the settlement agreement must be in Form N 182.\n\n---\n\nAllocation, reallocation, assignment, reassignment and case management\n\n(1) The Civil Procedure Rules lay down the overriding objective, the powers and duties of the court and the factors to which it must have regard in exercising them. The court will expect to exercise its powers as far as possible in co-operation with the parties and their legal representatives so as to deal with the case justly in accordance with that objective.\n\n(2) In most cases the court will expect to have enough information from the statements of case and directions questionnaires to be able to allocate the claim to a track, assign to a complexity band and to give case management directions.\n\n(3) If the court does not have enough information to allocate the claim or assign the claim to a complexity band, it will generally make an order under rule 26.7(4) requiring one or more parties to provide further information within 14 days.\n\n(4) Where there has been no allocation hearing or, where applicable, no assignment hearing, the notice of allocation will be in Forms N 154 (fast track), N 150 (intermediate track), N 155 (multi-track) or N 157 to 160 (small claims).\n\n(5)\n\n(a) the general rule is that the court will give brief reasons for its decision on allocation and, where applicable, on assignment, and these will be set out in the notice of allocation;\n\n(b) the general rule does not apply where all the directions questionnaires which have been filed have expressed the wish for the claim to be allocated to the track and, where applicable, assigned to the complexity band to which the court has respectively allocated and assigned it.\n\n(6) Paragraph 13 of this practice direction deals with allocation and assignment hearings and Paragraph 14 deals with allocation and assignment principles.\n\n(7) Rule 26.18 deals with reallocation and reassignment.\n\n(8)The practice directions supplementing Parts 27, 28 and 29 contain further information about the giving of case management directions at the allocation stage.\n\n---\n\nSummary judgment or other early termination\n\n10.\n\n(1) Part of the court's duty of active case management is the summary disposal of issues which do not need full investigation and trial (rule 1.4(2)(c)).\n\n(2) The court's powers to make orders to dispose of issues in that way include-\n\n(a) under rule 3.4, striking out a statement of case, or part of a statement of case; and\n\n(b) under Part 24, giving summary judgment where a claimant or a defendant has no reasonable prospect of success.\n\n(3) The court may use these powers on an application or on its own initiative. Practice Direction 24 contains further information.\n\n---\n\nSummary judgment or other early termination on application\n\n11.\n\n(1) A party intending to make such an application pursuant to paragraph 10 should do so before or when filing their directions questionnaire.\n\n(2) Where a party makes an application for such an order before a claim has been allocated to a track the court will not normally allocate the claim before the hearing of the application.\n\n(3) Where a party files a directions questionnaire stating that they intend to make such an application but has not done so, the judge will usually direct that an allocation hearing is listed.\n\n(4) The application may be heard at that allocation hearing if the application notice has been issued and served in sufficient time.\n\n---\n\nSummary judgment or other early termination on the court's initiative\n\n12.\n\n(1) This paragraph applies where the court proposes to make an order pursuant to paragraph 10 of its own initiative.\n\n(2) The court will not allocate the claim to a track but instead it will either-\n\n(a) fix a hearing, giving the parties at least 14 days' notice of the date of the hearing and of the issues which it is proposed that the court will decide; or\n\n(b) make an order directing a party to take the steps described in the order within a stated time and specifying the consequence of not taking those steps.\n\n(3)Where the court decides at the hearing of an application, or a hearing fixed under sub-paragraph (2)(a), that the claim (or part of the claim) is to continue it may-\n\n(a) treat that hearing as an allocation hearing, allocate the claim and, where applicable, assign the claim to a complexity band and give case management directions; or\n\n(b) give other directions.\n\n---\n\nAllocation and assignment hearings\n\n13.\n\n(1)The court will only hold an allocation hearing or, where applicable, an assignment hearing and on its own initiative if it considers that it is necessary to do so.\n\n(2)Where the court orders an allocation or assignment hearing to take place-\n\n(a) it will give the parties at least 7 days' notice of the hearing in Form N 153; and\n\n(b) Form N 153 will give a brief explanation of the decision to order the hearing.\n\n(3)Where the court may treat another hearing as an allocation hearing or an assignment hearing it does not need to give notice to any party that it proposes to do so.\n\n(4)The notice of allocation and, where applicable, assignment, after an allocation or assignment hearing will be in Forms N 154, N 155, N 150 or N 157.\n\n(5)A legal representative who attends an allocation or assignment hearing should, if possible, be the person responsible for the case and must in any event be familiar with the case, be able to provide the court with the information it is likely to need to take its decisions about allocation, assignment and case management, and have sufficient authority to deal with any issues that are likely to arise.\n\n---\n\nAllocation and assignment principles\n\n14.\n\n(1) Rule 26.9 sets out the scope of each track.\n\n(2) Rule 26.12 states the general rule for allocation.\n\n(3) Rule 26.13 sets out the matters relevant to allocation to a track and, where applicable, assignment to a complexity band.\n\n(4)Paragraphs (5) to (10) explain the court's general approach to some of the matters set out in rule 26.13.\n\n(5) Rule 26.13(2) provides that it is for the court to assess the financial value of a claim.\n\n(6) Where the court believes that the amount the claimant is seeking exceeds what they may reasonably be expected to recover it may make an order under rule 26.7(4) directing the claimant to justify the amount.\n\n(7) In deciding, for the purposes of rule 26.13(2)(a), whether an amount is in dispute the court will apply the following general principles-\n\n(a) any amount for which the defendant does not admit liability is in dispute;\n\n(b) any sum in respect of an item forming part of the claim for which judgment has been entered (for example a summary judgment) is not in dispute;\n\n(c) any specific sum claimed as a distinct item and which the defendant admits they are liable to pay is not in dispute; and\n\n(d) any sum offered by the defendant which has been accepted by the claimant in satisfaction of any item which forms a distinct part of the claim is not in dispute.\n\n(8) It follows from sub-paragraph (7) that if, in relation to a claim the value of which is above the small claims track limit of £10,000, the defendant makes, before allocation, an admission that reduces the amount in dispute to a figure below £10,000 (see CPR Part 14), the normal track for the claim will be the small claims track. As to recovery of pre-allocation costs, the claimant can, before allocation, apply for judgment with costs on the amount of the claim that has been admitted (see CPR rule 14.4 but see also paragraph 7.1(3) of Practice Direction 46 under which the court has a discretion to allow pre-allocation costs).\n\n(9)The court will treat the views expressed by the parties as an important factor, but decisions on allocation and assignment are for the court, to be taken in the light of all the circumstances, and the court will not be bound by any agreement or common view of the parties.\n\n(10)Where the case involves more than one money claim (for example where there is an additional claim or there is more than one claimant each making separate claims) the court will not generally aggregate the claims. Instead, it will generally regard the largest of them as determining the financial value of the claims.\n\n---\n\nThe small claims track - allocation and case management\n\n15.\n\n(1) The small claims track is intended to provide a proportionate procedure by which most straightforward claims with a financial value of not more than £10,000 can be decided, without the need for substantial pre-hearing preparation and the formalities of a traditional trial, and without incurring large legal costs. (Rule 26.9 provides for a lower financial value in certain types of case.)\n\n(2) The procedure laid down in Part 27 for the preparation of the case and the conduct of the hearing are designed to make it possible for a litigant to conduct their own case without legal representation if they wish.\n\n(3) Cases generally suitable for the small claims track will include consumer disputes, accident claims, disputes about the ownership of goods and most disputes between a landlord and contract-holder under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 or a landlord and tenant other than opposed claims under Part 56, disputed claims for possession under Part 55 and demotion claims or prohibited conduct standard contract order claims both as defined by rule 65.11, whether in the alternative to a claim for possession or under Part 65.\n\n(4) A case involving a disputed allegation of dishonesty will not usually be suitable for the small claims track.\n\n(5) The court may allocate to the small claims track a claim, the value of which is above the limits mentioned in rule 26.9(1). The court will not normally allow more than one day for the hearing of such a claim.\n\n(6) Directions for case management of claims allocated to the small claims track will generally be given by the court on allocation.\n\n(7) Rule 27.4 contains further provisions about directions and Practice Direction 27 sets out the standard directions which the court will usually give.\n\n---\n\nThe fast track - allocation and case management\n\n16.\n\n(1) Where the court is to decide whether to allocate to the fast track a claim for which the normal track is the fast track, it will allocate the claim to the fast track unless it believes that it cannot be dealt with justly on that track.\n\n(2) The court will, in particular, take into account the limits likely to be placed on disclosure, the extent to which expert evidence may be necessary and whether the trial is likely to last more than a day.\n\n(3)\n\n(a) when it is considering the likely length of the trial the court will regard a day as being a period of 5 hours, and will consider whether that is likely to be sufficient time for the case to be heard;\n\n(b) the court will also take into account the case management directions (including the fixing of a trial timetable) that are likely to be given and the court's powers to control evidence and to limit cross-examination;\n\n(c) subject to paragraph (e), the possibility that a trial might last longer than one day is not necessarily a conclusive reason for the court to allocate or to re-allocate a claim to the intermediate track or the multi-track;\n\n(d) a claim may be allocated to the fast track or ordered to remain on that track although there is to be a split trial;\n\n(e) where the case involves a counterclaim or additional claim that will be tried with the claim and as a result the trial will last more than a day, the court may not allocate it to the fast track.\n\n(4) Directions for the case management of claims which have been allocated to the fast track will be given at the allocation stage or at the listing stage (in either case with or without a hearing) or at both or and if necessary at other times. The trial judge may, at or before the trial, give directions for its conduct.\n\n(5) Practice Direction 28 contains further provisions and contains standard directions which the court may give.\n\n---\n\nThe intermediate track - allocation and case management\n\n17.\n\n(1)Part 26 and, in particular, rules 26.9(7) to (11), 26.12 and 26.13 make provision regarding the allocation of claims to the intermediate track.\n\n(2) Part 28 and Practice Direction 28 make provision regarding the case management of claims allocated to the intermediate track.\n\n---\n\nThe multi-track - venue for allocation and case management\n\n18.\n\n(1) Sub-paragraphs (2) to (13) do not apply to-\n\n(a) a claim for possession of land in the County Court or a demotion claim whether in the alternative to a possession claim or under Part 65;\n\n(b) a Renting Homes possession claim as defined by rule 55.30 in the County Court or a prohibited conduct standard contract order claim as defined by rule 65.11 whether in the alternative to a Renting Homes possession claim or under Part 65; or\n\n(c) any claim which is being dealt with at the Royal Courts of Justice.\n\n(2) The case management of a claim which is allocated to the multi-track will normally be dealt with at a Civil Trial Centre.\n\n(3) In the case of a claim to which any of Parts 49 or 58 to 62 apply, case management must be dealt with at a Civil Trial Centre. Sub-paragraphs (5) to (11) do not apply to such a claim. The claim will be allocated to the multi-track irrespective of its value, and must be transferred to a Civil Trial Centre for allocation and case management if not already there.\n\n(4) Where a claim is issued in or automatically transferred to a Civil Trial Centre it will be allocated and managed at that court.\n\n(5) The following sub-paragraphs apply to a claim which is issued in or automatically transferred to a court which is not a Civil Trial Centre. Such a court is referred to as a 'feeder court'.\n\n(6) Where a judge sitting at a feeder court decides, on the basis of the directions questionnaires and any other documents filed by the parties, that the claim should be dealt with on the multi-track they will normally make an order-\n\n(a) allocating the claim to that track;\n\n(b) giving case management directions; and\n\n(c) transferring the claim to a Civil Trial Centre.\n\n(7) If the judge decides that an allocation hearing, or some pre-allocation hearing is to take place (for example to strike out a statement of case under Part 3 of the Rules) that hearing will take place at the feeder court.\n\n(8) If, before allocation, a hearing takes place at a feeder court and in exercising their powers under paragraph 5.(a) above the judge allocates the claim to the multi-track, they will also normally make an order transferring the claim to a Civil Trial Centre.\n\n(9) A judge sitting at a feeder court may, rather than making an allocation order himself, transfer the claim to a Civil Trial Centre for the decision about allocation to be taken there.\n\n(10) When, following an order for transfer, the file is received at the Civil Trial Centre, a judge sitting at that Centre will consider it and give any further directions that appear necessary or desirable.\n\n(11) Where there is reason to believe that more than one case management conference may be needed and the parties or their legal advisers are located inconveniently far from the Civil Trial Centre, a judge sitting at a feeder court may, with the agreement of the Designated Civil Judge and notwithstanding the allocation of the case to the multi-track, decide that in the particular circumstances of the case it should not be transferred to a Civil Trial Centre, but should be case managed for the time being at the feeder court.\n\n(12) A Designated Civil Judge may at any time make an order transferring a claim from a feeder court to a Civil Trial Centre and may do so irrespective of the track, if any, to which it has been allocated. They may also permit a feeder court to keep for trial a claim or (subject to review from time to time) a category of claims. Any such permission should take into account the ability of the feeder court in relation to the Civil Trial Centre to provide suitable and effective trial within an appropriate trial period.\n\n(13) No order will be made by a feeder court fixing a date for a hearing at a Civil Trial Centre unless that date has been given or confirmed by a judge or listing officer of that Centre.\n\n(14)Part 29 of the Rules and Practice Direction 29 set out the procedure to be adopted regarding case management.\n\n---\n\nMoney claims sent to the County Court at Central London\n\n19.The County Court hearing centres referred to in rule 26.3(6)(c) are Barnet, Brentford, Bromley, Central London, Clerkenwell and Shoreditch, Croydon, Edmonton, Kingston-on-Thames, Lambeth, Mayors and City of London, Romford, Wandsworth, Willesden, and Uxbridge.\n\n---\n\nDetermining the amount to be paid under a judgment or order\n\n20.\n\n(1) In paragraphs 21 to 24-\n\n(a) a 'relevant order' means a judgment or order of the court which requires the amount of money to be paid by one party to another to be decided by the court; and\n\n(b) a 'disposal hearing' means a hearing in accordance with paragraph 23.\n\n(2) A relevant order may have been obtained-\n\n(a) by a judgment in default under Part 12;\n\n(b) by a judgment on an admission under Part 14;\n\n(c) on the striking out of a statement of case under Part 3;\n\n(d) on a summary judgment application under Part 24;\n\n(e) on the determination of a preliminary issue or on a trial as to liability; or\n\n(f) at trial.\n\n(3) A relevant order includes any order for the amount of a debt, damages or interest to be decided by the court (including an order for the taking of an account or the making of an inquiry as to any sum due, and any similar order), but does not include an order for the assessment of costs.\n\n---\n\nDirections on making a relevant order\n\n21.\n\n(1) When the court makes a relevant order it will give directions, which may include-\n\n(a) listing the claim for a disposal hearing;\n\n(b) allocating or re-allocating the claim (but see paragraph 22);\n\n(c) directing the parties to file directions questionnaires by a specified date; and\n\n(d) staying the claim while the parties try to settle the case by alternative dispute resolution or other means.\n\n(2) Directions may specify the level or type of judge before whom a hearing or a further hearing will take place and the nature and purpose of that hearing.\n\n(3) Where the parties apply for a relevant order by consent, they should if possible file with their draft consent order agreed directions for the court's approval.\n\n---\n\nAllocation on making a relevant order\n\n22.\n\n(1) If, when the court makes a relevant order-\n\n(a) the claim has not previously been allocated to a track; and\n\n(b) the financial value of the claim (determined in accordance with Part 26) is such that the claim would, if defended be allocated to the small claims track,\n\nthe court will normally allocate it to that track.\n\n(2) Where paragraph (1)(b) does not apply, the court will not normally allocate the claim to a track (other than the small claims track) unless-\n\n(a) the amount payable appears to be genuinely disputed on substantial grounds; or\n\n(b) the dispute is not suitable to be dealt with at a disposal hearing.\n\n---\n\nDisposal hearings\n\n23.\n\n(1) A disposal hearing is a hearing-\n\n(a) which will not normally last longer than 30 minutes, and\n\n(b) at which the court will not normally hear oral evidence.\n\n(2) At a disposal hearing the court may-\n\n(a) decide the amount payable under or in consequence of the relevant order and give judgment for that amount; or\n\n(b) give directions as to the future conduct of the proceedings.\n\n(3) If the claim has been allocated to the small claims track, or the court decides at the disposal hearing to allocate it to that track, the court may treat the disposal hearing as a final hearing in accordance with Part 27.\n\n(4) Rule 32.6 applies to evidence at a disposal hearing unless the court directs otherwise.\n\n(5) Except where the claim has been allocated to the small claims track, the court will not exercise its power under sub-paragraph (2)(a) unless any written evidence on which the claimant relies has been served on the defendant at least 3 days before the disposal hearing.\n\n---\n\nJurisdiction of Masters and District Judges\n\n24.\n\nUnless the court otherwise directs, a Master or a District Judge may decide the amount payable under a relevant order irrespective of the financial value of the claim and of the track to which the claim may have been allocated.\"",

    "content": "PART 27 - THE SMALL CLAIMS TRACK\n\n---\n\nContents of this Part\n\n---\n\nScope of this Part\n\n27.1\n\n(1) This Part -\n\n(a) sets out the special procedure for dealing with claims which have been allocated to the small claims track under Part 26; and\n\n(b) limits the amount of costs that can be recovered in respect of a claim which has been allocated to the small claims track.\n\n(Rule 27.14 deals with costs on the small claims track)\n\n(2) A claim being dealt with under this Part is called a small claim.\n\n(Rule 26.9 provides for the scope of the small claims track. A claim for a remedy for harassment or unlawful eviction relating, in either case, to residential premises or to a dwelling where the claim is under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 shall not be allocated to the small claims track whatever the financial value of the claim. Otherwise, the small claims track will be the normal track for -\n\n• any claim which has a financial value of not more than £10,000 subject to the special provisions about claims for personal injuries and housing disrepair claims;\n• any claim for personal injuries which has a financial value of not more than £10,000 where the claim for damages for personal injuries is not more than the relevant value specified in rule 26.9(1)(a)(ii)(aa), (bb) or (cc), being £5,000, £1,000 or £1,500, respectively; and\n• any claim which includes a claim by a tenant of residential premises against his landlord for repairs or other work to the premises where the estimated cost of the repairs or other work is not more than £1,000 and the financial value of any other claim for damages is not more than £1,000);\n• any claim which includes a claim under the Renting Home (Wales) Act 2016 by a contract-holder of a dwelling against their landlord for repairs or other work to the dwelling where the estimated cost of the repairs or other work is not more than £1,000 and the financial value of any other claim for damages is not more than £1,000).\n\n---\n\nExtent to which other Parts apply\n\n27.2\n\n(1) The following Parts of these Rules do not apply to small claims -\n\n(a) Part 25 (interim remedies) except as it relates to interim injunctions(GL);\n\n(b) Part 31 (disclosure and inspection);\n\n(c) Part 32 (evidence) except rule 32.1 (power of court to control evidence);\n\n(d) Part 33 (miscellaneous rules about evidence);\n\n(e) Part 35 (experts and assessors) except rules 35.1 (duty to restrict expert evidence), 35.3 (experts - overriding duty to the court), 35.7 (court's power to direct that evidence is to be given by single joint expert) and 35.8 (instructions to a single joint expert);\n\n(f) Subject to paragraph (3), Part 18 (further information);\n\n(g) Part 36 (offers to settle); and\n\n(h) Part 39 (hearings) except rule 39.2 (general rule- hearing to be in public) , rule 39.8 (communications with the court) and rule 39.9 (recording and transcription of proceedings.\n\n(2) The other Parts of these Rules apply to small claims except to the extent that a rule or a practice direction under this Part limits such application.\n\n(2 A) A rule or practice direction may, in relation to a specified type of small claim-\n\n(a) require or permit the use of the procedure set out in this Part; and\n\n(b) disapply or modify any of the rules set out in this Part.\n\n(3) The court of its own initiative may order a party to provide further information if it considers it appropriate to do so.\n\n---\n\nCourt's power to grant a final remedy\n\n27.3 The court may grant any final remedy in relation to a small claim which it could grant if the proceedings were on the fast track, the intermediate track or the multi-track.\n\n---\n\nPreparation for the hearing\n\n27.4\n\n(1) After allocation the court will -\n\n(a) give standard directions and fix a date for the final hearing;\n\n(b) give special directions and fix a date for the final hearing;\n\n(c) give special directions and direct that the court will consider what further directions are to be given no later than 28 days after the date the special directions were given;\n\n(d) fix a date for a preliminary hearing under rule 27.6; or\n\n(e) give notice that it proposes to deal with the claim without a hearing under rule 27.10 and invite the parties to notify the court by a specified date if they agree the proposal.\n\n(2) The court will -\n\n(a) give the parties at least 21 days' notice of the date fixed for the final hearing, unless the parties agree to accept less notice; and\n\n(b) inform them of the amount of time allowed for the final hearing.\n\n(3) In this rule -\n\n(a) 'standard directions' means -\n\n(i) a direction that each party shall, at least 14 days before the date fixed for the final hearing, file and serve on every other party copies of all documents (including any expert's report) on which he intends to rely at the hearing; and\n\n(ii) any other standard directions set out in Practice Direction 27 A; and\n\n(b) 'special directions' means directions given in addition to or instead of the standard directions.\n\n---\n\nExperts\n\n27.5 No expert may give evidence, whether written or oral, at a hearing without the permission of the court.\n\n( Rule 27.14(3)(d) provides for the payment of an expert's fees)\n\n---\n\nPreliminary hearing\n\n27.6\n\n(1) The court may hold a preliminary hearing for the consideration of the claim, but only -\n\n(a) where -\n\n(i) it considers that special directions, as defined in rule 27.4, are needed to ensure a fair hearing; and\n\n(ii) it appears necessary for a party to attend at court to ensure that he understands what he must do to comply with the special directions; or\n\n(b) to enable it to dispose of the claim on the basis that one or other of the parties has no real prospect of success at a final hearing; or\n\n(c) to enable it to strike out(GL)a statement of case or part of a statement of case on the basis that the statement of case, or the part to be struck out, discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim.\n\n(2) When considering whether or not to hold a preliminary hearing, the court must have regard to the desirability of limiting the expense to the parties of attending court.\n\n(3) Where the court decides to hold a preliminary hearing, it will give the parties at least 14 days' notice of the date of the hearing.\n\n(4) The court may treat the preliminary hearing as the final hearing of the claim if all the parties agree.\n\n(5) At or after the preliminary hearing the court will-\n\n(a) fix the date of the final hearing (if it has not been fixed already) and give the parties at least 21 days' notice of the date fixed unless the parties agree to accept less notice;\n\n(b) inform them of the amount of time allowed for the final hearing; and\n\n(c) give any appropriate directions.\n\n---\n\nPower of court to add to, vary or revoke directions\n\n27.7 The court may add to, vary or revoke directions.\n\n---\n\nConduct of the hearing\n\n27.8\n\n(1) The court may adopt any method of proceeding at a hearing that it considers to be fair.\n\n(2) Hearings will be informal.\n\n(3) The strict rules of evidence do not apply.\n\n(4) The court need not take evidence on oath.\n\n(5) The court may limit cross-examination(GL).\n\n(6) The court must give reasons for its decision.\n\n---\n\nNon-attendance of parties at a final hearing\n\n27.9\n\n(1) If a party who does not attend a final hearing-\n\n(a) has given written notice to the court and the other party at least 7 days before the hearing date that he will not attend;\n\n(b) has served on the other party at least 7 days before the hearing date any other documents which he has filed with the court;

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 27 A - SMALL CLAIMS TRACK\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Part 27\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nJudges\n\n1 The functions of the court described in Part 27 which are to be carried out by a judge will generally be carried out by a district judge but may be carried out by a Circuit Judge.\n\n---\n\nCase management directions\n\n2.1 Rule 27.4 explains how directions will be given, and rule 27.6 contains provisions about the holding of a preliminary hearing and the court's powers at such a hearing.\n\n2.2 Appendix A sets out details of the case that the court usually needs in the type of case described. Appendix B sets out the Standard Directions that the court may give. Appendix C sets out Special Directions that the court may give.\n\n2.3 Before allocating the claim to the Small Claims Track and giving directions for a hearing the court may require a party to give further information about that party's case.\n\n2.4 A party may ask the court to give particular directions about the conduct of the case.\n\n2.5 In deciding whether to make an order for exchange of witness statements the court will have regard to the following -\n\n(a) whether either or both the parties are represented;\n\n(b) the amount in dispute in the proceedings;\n\n(c) the nature of the matters in dispute;\n\n(d) whether the need for any party to clarify his case can better be dealt with by an order under paragraph 2.3;\n\n(e) the need for the parties to have access to justice without undue formality, cost or delay.\n\n---\n\nRepresentation at a hearing\n\n3.1 In this paragraph:\n\n(1) a lawyer means a barrister, a solicitor or a legal executive employed by a solicitor or any other person authorised under the Legal Services Act 2007 to act as a litigator or advocate; and\n\n(2) a lay representative means any other person.\n\n3.2\n\n(1) A party may present his own case at a hearing or a lawyer or lay representative may present it for him.\n\n(2) The Lay Representatives (Right of Audience) Order 1999 provides that a lay representative may not exercise any right of audience:-\n\n(a) where his client does not attend the hearing;\n\n(b) at any stage after judgment; or\n\n(c) on any appeal brought against any decision made by the district judge in the proceedings.\n\n(3) However the court, exercising its general discretion to hear anybody, may hear a lay representative even in circumstances excluded by the Order.\n\n(4) Any of its officers or employees may represent a corporate party.\n\n---\n\nSmall claim hearing\n\n4.1 OMITTED\n\n4.2 A hearing that takes place at the court will generally be in the judge's room but it may take place in a courtroom.\n\n4.3 Rule 27.8 allows the court to adopt any method of proceeding that it considers to be fair and to limit cross-examination. The judge may in particular:\n\n(1) ask questions of any witness himself before allowing any other person to do so,\n\n(2) ask questions of all or any of the witnesses himself before allowing any other person to ask questions of any witnesses,\n\n(3) refuse to allow cross-examination of any witness until all the witnesses have given evidence in chief,\n\n(4) limit cross-examination of a witness to a fixed time or to a particular subject or issue, or both.\n\n---\n\nRecording evidence and the giving of reasons\n\n5.1 A hearing that takes place at the court will be tape recorded by the court. A party may obtain a transcript of such a recording on payment of the proper transcriber's charges.\n\n5.2 Attention is drawn to section 9 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 (which deals with the unauthorised use of tape recorders in court) and to the Practice Direction ([1981] 1 WLR 1526) which relates to it.\n\n5.3\n\n(1) The judge may give reasons for his judgment as briefly and simply as the nature of the case allows.\n\n(2) He will normally do so orally at the hearing, but he may give them later at a hearing either orally or in writing.\n\n5.4 Where the judge decides the case without a hearing under rule 27.10 or a party who has given notice under rule 27.9(1) does not attend the hearing, the judge will prepare a note of his reasons and the court will send a copy to each party.\n\n5.5 Nothing in this practice direction affects the duty of a judge at the request of a party to make a note of the matters referred to in section 80 of the County Courts Act 1984.\n\n---\n\nNon-attendance of a party at a hearing\n\n6.1 Attention is drawn to rule 27.9 (which enables a party to give notice that he will not attend a final hearing and sets out the effect of his giving such notice and of not doing so), and to paragraph 3 above.\n\n6.2 Nothing in those provisions affects the general power of the court to adjourn a hearing, for example where a party who wishes to attend a hearing on the date fixed cannot do so for a good reason.\n\n---\n\nCosts\n\n7.1 Attention is drawn to Rule 27.14 which contains provisions about the costs which may be ordered to be paid by one party to another.\n\n7.2 The amount which a party may be ordered to pay under rule 27.14(2)(b) (for legal advice and assistance in claims including an injunction or specific performance) is a sum not exceeding £260.\n\n7.3 The amounts which a party may be ordered to pay under rule 27.14(2)(e) (loss of earnings) and (f) (experts' fees) are:\n\n(1) for the loss of earnings or loss of leave of each party or witness due to attending a hearing or staying away from home for the purpose of attending a hearing, a sum not exceeding £95 per day for each person, and\n\n(2) for experts' fees, a sum not exceeding £750 for each expert.\n\n(As to recovery of pre-allocation costs in a case in which an admission by the defendant has reduced the amount in dispute to a figure below £10,000, reference should be made to paragraph 7.4 of Practice Direction 26 and to paragraph 7.1(3) of Practice Direction 46.)\n\n---\n\nAppeals\n\n8.1 Part 52 deals with appeals and attention is drawn to that Part and Practice Direction 52.\n\n8 AAn appellant's notice in small claims must be filed and served in Form N 164.\n\n8.2 Where the court dealt with the claim to which the appellant is a party:\n\n(1) under rule 27.10 without a hearing; or\n\n(2) in his absence because he gave notice under rule 27.9 requesting the court to decide the claim in his absence,\n\nan application for permission to appeal must be made to the appeal court.\n\n8.3 Where an appeal is allowed the appeal court will, if possible, dispose of the case at the same time without referring the claim to the lower court or ordering a new hearing. It may do so without hearing further evidence.\n\n---\n\nAppendix A: INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION THE COURT USUALLY NEEDS IN PARTICULAR TYPES OF CASE\n\n---\n\nROAD ACCIDENT CASES (where the information or documentation is available)\n\n• witness statements (including statements from the parties themselves);\n• invoices and estimates for repairs;\n• agreements and invoices for any car hire costs;\n• the Police accident report;\n• sketch plan which should wherever possible be agreed;\n• photographs of the scene of the accident and of the damage.\n\n---\n\nBUILDING DISPUTES, REPAIRS, GOODS SOLD AND SIMILAR CONTRACTUAL CLAIMS (where the information or documentation is available)\n\n• any written contract;\n• photographs;\n• any plans;\n• a list of works complained of;\n• a list of any outstanding works;\n• any relevant estimate, invoice or receipt including any relating to repairs to each of the defects;\n• invoices for work done or goods supplied;\n• estimates for work to be completed;\n• a valuation of work done to date.\n\n---\n\nLANDLORD AND TENANT CLAIMS, AND LANDLORD AND CONTRACT-HOLDER CLAIMS UNDER THE RENTING HOMES (WALES) ACT 2016 (where the information or documentation is available)\n\n• a calculation of the amount of any rent alleged to be owing, showing amounts received;\n• details of breaches of an agreement which are said to justify withholding any deposit itemised showing how the total is made up and with invoices and estimates to support them.\n\n---\n\nBREACH OF DUTY CASES (negligence, deficient professional services and the like)\n\nDetails of the following:\n\n• what it is said by the claimant was done negligently by the defendant;\n• why it is said that the negligence is the fault of the defendant;\n• what damage is said to have been caused;\n• what injury or losses have been suffered and how any (and each) sum claimed has been calculated;\n• the response of the defendant to each of the above.\n\n---\n\nAppendix B: STANDARD DIRECTIONS\n\n(For use where the district judge specifies no other directions)\n\nTHE COURT DIRECTS:\n\n1 Each party must deliver to every other party and to the court office copies of all documents on which he intends to rely at the hearing no later than [ ] [14 days before the hearing]. (These should include the letter making the claim and the reply.)\n\n2 The original documents must be brought to the hearing.\n\n3[Notice of hearing date and time allowed.]\n\n4 The parties are encouraged to contact each other with a view to trying to settle the case or narrow the issues. However the court must be informed immediately if the case is settled by agreement before the hearing date.\n\n5 No party may rely at the hearing on any report from an expert unless express permission has been granted by the court beforehand. Anyone wishing to rely on an expert must write to the court immediately on receipt of this Order and seek permission, giving an explanation why the assistance of an expert is necessary.\n\nNOTE: Failure to comply with the directions may result in the case being adjourned and in the party at fault having to pay costs. The parties are encouraged always to try to settle the case by negotiating with each other. The court must be informed immediately if the case is settled before the hearing.\n\n---\n\nAppendix C: SPECIAL DIRECTIONS\n\nThe must clarify his case.\n\nHe must do this by delivering to the court office and to the no later than\n\n[a list of ]\n\n[details of ]\n\nThe must allow the to inspect by appointment within days of receiving a request to do so.\n\nThe hearing will not take place at the court but at .\n\nThe must bring to court at the hearing the .\n\nSigned statements setting out the evidence of all witnesses on whom each party intends to rely must be prepared and copies included in the documents mentioned in paragraph 1. This includes the evidence of the parties themselves and of any other witness, whether or not he is going to come to court to give evidence.\n\nThe court may decide not to take into account a document [or video] or the evidence of a witness if these directions have not been complied with.\n\nIf he does not [do so] [ ] his [Claim][Defence] [and Counterclaim] will be struck out and (specify consequence).\n\nIt appears to the court that expert evidence is necessary on the issue of and that that evidence should be given by a single expert to be instructed by the parties jointly. If the parties cannot agree about who to choose and what arrangements to make about paying his fee, either party MUST apply to the court for further directions. The evidence is to be given in the form of a written report. Either party may ask the expert questions and must then send copies of the questions and replies to the other party and to the court. Oral expert evidence may be allowed in exceptional circumstances but only after a further order of the court. Attention is drawn to the limit of £750 on expert's fees that may be recovered.\n\nIf either party intends to show a video as evidence he must -\n\n(a) contact the court at once to make arrangements for him to do so, because the court may not have the necessary equipment, and\n\n(b) provide the other party with a copy of the video or the opportunity to see it at least days before the hearing.",

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 28 - THE FAST TRACK AND THE INTERMEDIATE TRACK\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Part 28\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nSECTION I GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLYING TO BOTH FAST TRACK AND INTERMEDIATE TRACK\n\n---\n\n1. General\n\n1.1 This section contains general provisions about the management of cases allocated to the fast and intermediate tracks. Section II contains further provisions about the management of cases allocated to the fast track.\n\n---\n\n2.Case management - fast track and intermediate track\n\n2.1 Case management of cases allocated to the fast track and the intermediate track will generally be by directions given at one or more of the following stages in the case-\n\n(a) at allocation to the track, whether on paper or at a case management conference;\n\n(b) on the filing of any pre-trial check lists (listing questionnaires); and\n\n(c) at any pre-trial review.\n\n2.2 The court will hold a hearing to give directions whenever it appears necessary or desirable to do so. Where this happens because of the default of a party or their legal representative, it will usually impose a sanction.\n\n2.3 The court may give directions at any hearing on the application of a party or on its own initiative.\n\n2.4 When any hearing has been fixed it is the duty of the parties to consider what directions the court should be asked to give and to make any application that may be appropriate to be dealt with at that hearing.\n\n2.5 When the court fixes a hearing to give directions it will give the parties at least 3 days' notice of the hearing.\n\n2.6 Where a party needs to apply for a direction of a kind not included in the case management timetable which has been set (for example to amend their statement of case or for further information to be given by another party) they must do so as soon as possible so as to minimise the need to change that timetable.\n\n2.7 Courts will make arrangements to ensure that applications and other hearings are listed promptly to avoid delay in the conduct of cases.\n\n---\n\n3.Directions on allocation\n\n3.1 Attention is drawn to the court's duty under rule 28.2 to set a case management timetable and to fix a trial date or a trial period, and to the matters which are to be dealt with by directions under Rule 28.7 and Rule 28.15.\n\n3.2 The court will seek to tailor its directions to the needs of the case and the steps of which it is aware that the parties have already taken to prepare the case. In particular it will have regard to the extent to which Practice Direction (Pre-Action Conduct) or any pre-action protocol has or (as the case may be) has not been complied with.\n\n3.3 At this stage the court's first concern will be to ensure that the issues between the parties be identified and that the necessary evidence is prepared and disclosed.\n\n3.4 The court may have regard to any document filed by a party with their directions questionnaire containing further information provided that the document states either that its contents have been agreed with every other party or that it has been served on every other party and when it was served. In noise induced hearing loss claims any defendant requesting a preliminary trial on limitation must file a document with their directions questionnaire which identifies the evidence and legal argument said to give that defendant a real prospect of success on the issue of limitation.\n\n3.5 If-\n\n(a) the parties have filed agreed directions for the management of the case; and\n\n(b) the court considers that the proposals are suitable,\n\nit may approve them and give directions in the terms proposed.\n\n3.6\n\n(1) To obtain the court's approval the agreed directions must-\n\n(a) set out a timetable by reference to calendar dates for the taking of steps for the preparation of the case;\n\n(b) include a date or a period (the trial period) when it is proposed that the trial will take place;\n\n(c) include provision about disclosure of documents; and\n\n(d) include provision about both factual and expert evidence.\n\n(2) The provision in paragraph (1)(d) may be to the effect that no expert evidence is required.\n\n3.7 Directions agreed by the parties should also, where appropriate, contain provisions about-\n\n(a) the filing of any reply or amended statement of case that may be required;\n\n(b) dates for the service of requests for further information under Practice Direction 18 and questions to experts under rule 35.6 and when they are to be dealt with;\n\n(c) the disclosure of evidence; and\n\n(d) the use of a single joint expert or, in cases where the use of a single expert has not been agreed, the exchange and agreement of expert evidence (including whether exchange is to be simultaneous or sequential) and without prejudice discussions of the experts.\n\n3.8 If the court does not approve the agreed directions filed by the parties but decides that it will give directions on its own initiative without a hearing, it will take them into account in deciding what directions to give.\n\n3.9 Where the court is to give directions on its own initiative and it is not aware of any steps taken by the parties other than the service of statements of case, its general approach will be-\n\n(a) to give directions for the filing and service of any further information required to clarify either party's case;\n\n(b) to direct disclosure between the parties in accordance with rule 31.5;\n\n(c) to direct the disclosure of witness statements by way of simultaneous exchange;\n\n(d) to give directions for a single joint expert unless there is good reason not to do so; and\n\n(e) in cases where directions for a single expert are not given-\n\n(i) to direct disclosure of experts' reports by way of simultaneous exchange; and\n\n(ii) if experts' reports are not agreed, to direct a discussion between the experts for the purpose set out in rule 35.12(1) and the preparation of a report under rule 35.12(3).\n\n3.10 Where the court is proposing on its own initiative to make an order under rule 35.15 (which gives the court power to appoint an assessor), the court must, unless the parties have consented in writing to the order, list a directions hearing.\n\n3.11 The standard period between the giving of directions and the trial will be not more than 30 weeks.\n\n---\n\n4. Variation of directions\n\n4.1 Paragraphs 4.2 to 4.5 deal with the procedure to be adopted-\n\n(a) where a party is dissatisfied with a direction given by the court;\n\n(b) where the parties agree about changes they wish made to the directions given; or\n\n(c) where a party wishes to apply to vary a direction.\n\n4.2\n\n(1) It is essential that any party who wishes to have a direction varied takes steps to do so as soon as possible.\n\n(2) The court will assume for the purposes of any later application that a party who did not appeal and who made no application to vary within 14 days of service of the order containing the directions was content that they were correct in the circumstances then existing.\n\n4.3\n\n(1) Where a party is dissatisfied with a direction given or other order made by the court they may appeal or apply to the court for it to reconsider its decision.\n\n(2) They should appeal if the direction was given or the order was made at a hearing at which they were present or represented, or of which they had due notice.\n\n(3) In any other case they should apply to the court to reconsider its decision.\n\n(4) If an application is made for the court to reconsider its decision-\n\n(a) it will usually be heard by the judge who gave the directions or another judge of the same level;\n\n(b) the court will give all parties at least 3 days' notice of the hearing; and\n\n(c) the court may confirm its decision or make a different order.\n\n4.4 Where there has been a change in the circumstances since the order was made the court may set aside or vary any direction it has given. It may do so on application or on its own initiative.\n\n4.5\n\n(1) Where the parties agree about changes to be made to the directions given, if rule 2.11 (variation by agreement of a date set by the court for doing any act other than those stated in the note to that rule), rule 3.8(4) (extensions of time by written agreement in circumstances within rule 3.8(3)) or rule 31.5, 31.10(8) or 31.13 (agreements about disclosure) apply, the parties need not file the written agreement.\n\n(2) In any other case-\n\n(a) the parties must-\n\n(i) apply for an order by consent; and\n\n(ii) file a draft of the order sought and an agreed statement of the reasons why the variation is sought; and\n\n(b) the court may make an order in the agreed terms or in other terms without a hearing, but it may direct that a hearing is to be listed.\n\n---\n\n5.Failure to comply with case management directions\n\n5.1 Where a party has failed to comply with a direction given by the court any other party may apply for an order to enforce compliance or for a sanction to be imposed or both of these.\n\n5.2 The party entitled to apply for such an order must do so without delay but should first warn the other party of their intention to do so.\n\n5.3 The court may take any such delay into account when it decides whether to make an order imposing a sanction or whether to grant relief from a sanction imposed by the rules or any practice direction.\n\n5.4\n\n(1) The court will not allow a failure to comply with directions to lead to the postponement of the trial unless the circumstances of the case are exceptional.\n\n(2) If it is practicable to do so the court will exercise its powers in a manner that enables the case to come on for trial on the date or within the period previously set.\n\n(3) In particular the court will assess what steps each party should take to prepare the case for trial, direct that those steps are taken in the shortest possible time and impose a sanction for non-compliance. Such a sanction may, for example, deprive a party of the right to raise or contest an issue or to rely on evidence to which the direction relates.\n\n(4) Where it appears that one or more issues are or can be made ready for trial at the time fixed while others cannot, the court may direct that the trial will proceed on the issues which are or will then be ready, and order that no costs will be allowed for any later trial of the remaining issues or that those costs will be paid by the party in default.\n\n(5) Where the court has no option but to postpone the trial it will do so for the shortest possible time and will give directions for the taking of the necessary steps in the meantime as rapidly as possible.\n\n(6) Litigants and lawyers must be in no doubt that the court will regard the postponement of a trial as an order of last resort. The court may exercise its power to require a party as well as their legal representative to attend court at a hearing where such an order is to be sought.\n\n---\n\n6. Pre-trial check lists (listing questionnaires)\n\n6.1\n\n(1) The pre-trial check list (listing questionnaire) will be in Form N 170.\n\n(2) Unless it has dispensed with pre-trial check lists, the court will send Forms N 170 and N 171 (Notice of date for return of the pre-trial check list) to each party no later than 2 weeks before the date specified in the notice of allocation or in any later direction of the court for the return of the completed check lists.\n\n(3) When all the pre-trial check lists have been filed or when the time for filing them has expired and where a party has filed a pre-trial checklist, but another party has not done so, the file will be placed before a judge for their directions.\n\n(4) Although the Rules do not require the parties to exchange copies of the check lists before they are filed they are encouraged to do so to avoid the court being given conflicting or incomplete information.\n\n6.2 Attention is drawn to rule 28.4(1) (which sets out the court's duty at the pre-trial check list stage) and to rule 28.4(4) (which sets out circumstances in which the court may decide to hold a hearing).\n\n6.3\n\n(1) Where the judge decides to hold a hearing under rule 28.4(4) the court will fix a date which is as early as possible, and the parties will be given at least 3 days' notice of the date.\n\n(2) The notice of such a hearing will be in Form N 153.\n\n6.4 The court's general approach will be as set out in the following paragraphs. The court may however decide to make other orders, and in particular the court will take into account the steps, if any, which the parties have taken to prepare the case for trial.\n\n6.5\n\n(1) Where no party files a pre-trial checklist the court will order that unless a completed pre-trial checklist is filed within 7 days from service of that order, the claim, defence and any counterclaim will be struck out without further order of the court.\n\n(2) Where a party files a pre-trial check list, but another party does not do so, the court normally will give directions. These will usually fix or confirm the trial date and provide for steps to be taken to prepare the case for trial.\n\n---\n\n7.Directions the court will give on listing\n\n7.1 Directions the court must give-\n\n(a) the court must confirm or fix the trial date, specify the place of trial and give a time estimate. The trial date must be fixed, and the case listed on the footing that the hearing will end on the same calendar day as that on which it commenced.\n\n(b) the court will serve a notice of hearing on the parties at least 3 weeks before the hearing unless they agree to accept shorter notice or the court authorises shorter service under rule 28.5(2), and\n\n(c) the notice of hearing will be in Form N 172.\n\n7.2(Other directions)\n\n(1) The parties should seek to agree directions and may file the proposed order. The court may make an order in those terms, or it may make a different order.\n\n(2) Agreed directions should include provision about-\n\n(a) evidence;\n\n(b) a trial timetable and time estimate;\n\n(c) the preparation of a trial bundle; and\n\n(d) any other matter needed to prepare the case for trial.\n\n(3) The court will include such of these provisions as are appropriate in any order that it may make, whether or not the parties have filed agreed directions.\n\n(4)\n\n(a) a direction giving permission to use expert evidence will say whether it gives permission for oral evidence or reports or both and will name the experts concerned;\n\n(b) the court will not make a direction giving permission for an expert to give oral evidence unless it believes it is necessary in the interests of justice to do so;\n\n(c) where no 'without prejudice' meeting or other discussion between experts has taken place, the court may grant that permission conditionally on such a discussion taking place and a report being filed before the trial.\n\n7.3 The principles set out in paragraph 4 of this practice direction about the variation of directions apply also to directions given at this stage.\n\n---\n\n8.The trial\n\n8.1 The trial will normally take place at the court where the case is being managed, but it may be at another court if it is appropriate having regard to the needs of the parties and the availability of court resources.\n\n8.2 The judge will generally have read the papers in the trial bundle and may dispense with an opening address.\n\n8.3 The judge may confirm or vary any timetable given previously, or if none has been given set one.\n\n8.4 Attention is drawn to the provisions in Part 32 and the following parts of the Rules about evidence, and in particular-\n\n(a) to rule 32.1 (court's power to control evidence and to restrict cross-examination); and\n\n(b) to rule 32.5(2) (witness statements to stand as evidence in chief).\n\n---\n\nSECTION II PROVISIONS APPLYING ONLY TO CASES ALLOCATED TO THE FAST TRACK\n\n---\n\n9. Further provisions about directions\n\n9.1 The court will seek whenever possible to give directions without the need for a hearing to take place.\n\n9.2\n\n(1) If it appears to the court that the claim is one which will be allocated to the fast track but that it cannot properly give directions on its own initiative or approve agreed directions that have been filed, the court may either-\n\n(a) allocate the claim to the fast track, fix a trial date or trial period and direct that a case management hearing is to be listed and give directions at that hearing; or\n\n(b) direct that an allocation hearing is to be listed and give directions at that hearing.\n\n(2) In either case the hearing will be listed as promptly as possible.\n\n9.3 When considering disclosure of documents under 3.6(1)(c) above the court may direct that disclosure will take place by the supply of copy documents without a list, but it must in that case either direct that the parties must serve a disclosure statement with the copies or record that they have agreed to disclose in that way without such a statement.\n\n9.4 Relevant standard directions can be found at: http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil. When making an order the court will as far as possible base its order on those forms. Agreed directions which the parties file and invite the court to make should also be based on those forms.\n\n9.5 The table set out below contains a typical timetable the court may give for the preparation of the case.\n\nDisclosure\n\n4 weeks\n\nExchange of witness statements\n\n10 weeks\n\nExchange of experts' reports\n\n14 weeks\n\nSending of pre-trial check lists (listing questionnaires) by the court\n\n20 weeks\n\nFiling of completed pre-trial check lists\n\n22 weeks\n\nHearing\n\n30 weeks\n\nThese periods will run from the date of the notice of allocation.\n\n9.6\n\n(1) Where it considers that some or all of the steps in that timetable are not necessary the court may omit them and direct an earlier trial.\n\n(2) This may happen where the court is informed that Practice Direction (Pre-Action Conduct) or any pre-action protocol has been complied with or that steps which it would otherwise order to be taken have already been taken.\n\n(3) It may also happen where an application (for example for summary judgment or for an injunction) has been heard before allocation and little or no further preparation is required. In such a case the court may dispense with the need for a pre-trial check list.\n\n---\n\n10. Further provisions about the trial\n\n10.1 The latest proposed date for the trial or the end of the trial period must be not later than 30 weeks from the date the directions order is made.\n\n10.2 The trial period must not be longer than 3 weeks.\n\n10.3 Where a trial is not finished on the day for which it is listed the judge will normally sit on the next court day to complete it.\n\n10.4 Save where costs are fixed under Sections VI, Section VIII and Section IX of Part 45, paragraph 9.2 of Practice Direction 44 applies in the fast track.",

Where the court approves agreed directions, or issues its own directions, the parties will be so notified by the court and the case management conference will be vacated.\n\n---\n\nVariation of case management timetable\n\n29.5\n\n(1) A party must apply to the court if he wishes to vary the date which the court has fixed for -\n\n(a) a case management conference;\n\n(b) a pre-trial review;\n\n(c) the return of a pre-trial check list under rule 29.6;\n\n(d) the trial; or\n\n(e) the trial period.\n\n(2) Any date set by the court or these Rules for doing any act may not be varied by the parties if the variation would make it necessary to vary any of the dates mentioned in paragraph (1).\n\n(Rule 2.11 allows the parties to vary a date by written agreement except where the rules provide otherwise or the court orders otherwise)\n\n---\n\nPre-trial check list (listing questionnaire)\n\n29.6\n\n(1) The court will send the parties a pre-trial check list (listing questionnaire) for completion and return by the date specified in directions given under rule 29.2(3) unless it considers that the claim can proceed to trial without the need for a pre-trial check list.\n\n(2) Each party must file the completed pre-trial check list by the date specified by the court.\n\n(3) If no party files the completed pre-trial checklist by the date specified, the court will order that unless a completed pre-trial checklist is filed within 7 days from service of that order, the claim, defence and any counterclaim will be struck out without further order of the court.\n\n(4) If -\n\n(a) a party files a completed pre-trial checklist but another party does not;\n\n(b) a party has failed to give all the information requested by the pre-trial checklist; or\n\n(c) the court considers that a hearing is necessary to enable it to decide what directions to give in order to complete preparation of the case for trial,\n\nthe court may give such directions as it thinks appropriate.\n\n---\n\nPre-trial review\n\n29.7 If, on receipt of the parties' pre-trial check lists, the court decides -\n\n(a) to hold a pre-trial review; or\n\n(b) to cancel a pre-trial review which has already been fixed,\n\nit will serve notice of its decision at least 7 days before the date fixed for the hearing or, as the case may be, the cancelled hearing.\n\n---\n\nSetting a trial timetable and confirming the trial date or week\n\n29.8 As soon as practicable after -\n\n(a) each party has filed a completed pre-trial check list;\n\n(b) the court has held a listing hearing under rule 29.6(3); or\n\n(c) the court has held a pre-trial review under rule 29.7,\n\nthe court will -\n\n(i) set a timetable for the trial unless a timetable has already been fixed, or the court considers that it would be inappropriate to do so;\n\n(ii) confirm the date for trial or the week within which the trial is to begin; and\n\n(iii) notify the parties of the trial timetable (where one is fixed under this rule) and the date or trial period.\n\n---\n\nConduct of trial\n\n29.9 Unless the trial judge otherwise directs, the trial will be conducted in accordance with any order previously made.",

Claims suitable for trial in the Royal Courts of Justice include:\n\n(1) professional negligence claims,\n\n(2) Fatal Accident Act claims,\n\n(3) fraud or undue influence claims,\n\n(4) defamation claims,\n\n(5) claims for malicious prosecution or false imprisonment,\n\n(6) claims against the police,\n\n(7) contentious probate claims.\n\nSuch claims may fall within the criteria of article 7(5) of the High Court and County Courts Jurisdiction Order 1991.\n\n2.6 AIf the claim falls within a specialist list or area of work (i.e. Chancery, Commercial/Mercantile, or TCC), and concerns a dispute arising in a region outside London, the parties are required to explain in their directions questionnaire how and why the case is not suitable to be heard in the appropriate regional specialist court. Those regional specialist court centres have been set up to deal with appropriate cases out of London, so the parties will need to state in detail why, despite the availability of a regional specialist court, they wish the case to be heard in London.\n\n2.7 Attention is drawn to Practice Direction 30.\n\n---\n\nCase management - general provisions\n\n3.1\n\n(1) Case management of a claim which is proceeding at the Royal Courts of Justice will be undertaken there.\n\n(2)\n\n(a) Case management of any other claim which has been allocated to the multi-track will normally be undertaken at a Civil Trial Centre.\n\n(b) Practice Direction 26 provides for what will happen in the case of a claim which is issued in or transferred to a court which is not a Civil Trial Centre.\n\n3.2 The hallmarks of the multi-track are:\n\n(1) the ability of the court to deal with cases of widely differing values and complexity, and\n\n(2) the flexibility given to the court in the way it will manage a case in a way appropriate to its particular needs.\n\n3.3\n\n(1) On allocating a claim to the multi-track the court may give directions without a hearing, including fixing a trial date or a period in which the trial will take place,\n\n(2) Alternatively, whether or not it fixes a trial date or period, it may either -\n\n(a) give directions for certain steps to be taken and fix a date for a case management conference or a pre-trial review to take place after they have been taken, or\n\n(b) fix a date for a case management conference.\n\n(3) Attention is drawn to rule 29.2(2) which requires the court to fix a trial date or period as soon as practicable.\n\n3.4 The court may give or vary directions at any hearing which may take place on the application of a party or of its own initiative.\n\n3.5 When any hearing has been fixed it is the duty of the parties to consider what directions the court should be asked to give and to make any application that may be appropriate to be dealt with then.\n\n3.6 The court will hold a hearing to give directions whenever it appears necessary or desirable to do so, and where this happens because of the default of a party or his legal representative it will usually impose a sanction.\n\n3.7 When the court fixes a hearing to give directions it will give the parties at least 3 days' notice of the hearing unless rule 29.7 applies (7 days' notice to be given in the case of a pre-trial review).\n\n3.8 Where a party needs to apply for a direction of a kind not included in the case management timetable which has been set (for example to amend his statement of case or for further information to be given by another party) he must do so as soon as possible so as to minimise the need to change that timetable.\n\n3.9 Courts will make arrangements to ensure that applications and other hearings are listed promptly to avoid delay in the conduct of cases.\n\n3.10\n\n(1) Case management will generally be dealt with by:\n\n(a) a Master in cases proceeding in the Royal Courts of Justice,\n\n(b) a district judge in cases proceeding in a District Registry of the High Court, and\n\n(c) a district judge or a Circuit Judge in cases proceeding in a county court.\n\n(2) A Master or a district judge may consult and seek the directions of a judge of a higher level about any aspect of case management.\n\n(3) A member of the court staff who is dealing with the listing of a hearing may seek the directions of any judge about any aspect of that listing.\n\n---\n\nCase management - consideration of periodical payments\n\n3 AAttention is drawn to Practice Direction 41 B supplementing Part 41 and in particular to the direction that in a personal injury claim the court should consider and indicate to the parties as soon as practicable whether periodical payments or a lump sum is likely to be the more appropriate form for all or part of an award of damages for future pecuniary loss.\n\n---\n\nDirections on allocation\n\n4.1 Attention is drawn to the court's duties under Rule 29.2.\n\n4.2 The court will seek to tailor its directions to the needs of the case and the steps which the parties have already taken to prepare the case of which it is aware. In particular it will have regard to the extent to which Practice Direction (Pre-Action Conduct) or any pre-action protocol has or (as the case may be) has not been complied with.\n\n4.3 At this stage the court's first concern will be to ensure that the issues between the parties are identified and that the necessary evidence is prepared and disclosed.\n\n4.4 The court may have regard to any document filed by a party with his directions questionnaire containing further information, provided that the document states either that its contents has been agreed with every other party or that it has been served on every other party, and when it was served.\n\n4.5 On the allocation of a claim to the multi-track the court will consider whether it is desirable or necessary to hold a case management conference straight away, or whether it is appropriate instead to give directions on its own initiative.\n\n4.6 Attention is drawn to rule 29.4, which provides that parties must endeavour to agree appropriate directions for the management of the proceedings, and requires the agreed directions or proposals to be submitted to the court within a specified time period.\n\n4.7\n\n(1) To obtain the court's approval the agreed directions must -\n\n(a) set out a timetable by reference to calendar dates for the taking of steps for the preparation of the case,\n\n(b) include a date or a period (the trial period) when it is proposed that the trial will take place,\n\n(c) include provision about disclosure of documents, and\n\n(d) include provision about both factual and expert evidence.\n\n(2) The court will scrutinise the timetable carefully and in particular will be concerned to see that any proposed date or period for the trial and (if provided for) for a case management conference is no later than is reasonably necessary.\n\n(3) The provision in (1)(c) above may -\n\n(a) limit disclosure to standard disclosure or less than that, and/or\n\n(b) direct that disclosure will take place by the supply of copy documents without a list, but it must in that case say either that the parties must serve a disclosure statement with the copies or that they have agreed to disclose in that way without such a statement.\n\n(4) The provision in (1)(d) about expert evidence may be to the effect that none is required.\n\n4.8 Directions agreed by the parties should also where appropriate contain provisions about:\n\n(1) the filing of any reply or amended statement of case that may be required,\n\n(2) dates for the service of requests for further information under Practice Direction 18 and of questions to experts under rule 35.6 and by when they are to be dealt with,\n\n(3) the disclosure of evidence,\n\n(4) the use of a single joint expert, or in cases where it is not agreed, the exchange of expert evidence (including whether exchange is to be simultaneous or sequential) and without prejudice discussions between experts.\n\n(see paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 of Practice Direction 35)\n\n4.9 If the court does not approve the agreed directions filed by the parties but decides that it will give directions of its own initiative without fixing a case management conference, it will take them into account in deciding what directions to give.\n\n4.10 Where the court is to give directions on its own initiative without holding a case management conference and it is not aware of any steps taken by the parties other than the exchange of statements of case, its general approach will be:\n\n(1) to give directions for the filing and service of any further information required to clarify either party's case,\n\n(2) to direct standard disclosure between the parties,\n\n(3) to direct the disclosure of witness statements by way of simultaneous exchange,\n\n(4) to give directions for a single joint expert on any appropriate issue unless there is a good reason not to do so,\n\n(5) unless paragraph 4.11 (below) applies, to direct disclosure of experts' reports by way of simultaneous exchange on those issues where a single joint expert is not directed,\n\n(6) if experts' reports are not agreed, to direct a discussion between experts for the purpose set out in rule 35.12(1) and the preparation of a statement under rule 35.12(3),\n\n(7) to list a case management conference to take place after the date for compliance with those directions,\n\n(8) to specify a trial period; and\n\n(9) in such cases as the court thinks appropriate, the court may give directions ordering or encouraging the parties to engage in alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Such directions may be, for example, in the following terms:\n\nThe parties shall by [date] consider whether the case is capable of resolution by ADR. If any party considers that the case is unsuitable for resolution by ADR, that party shall be prepared to justify that decision at the conclusion of the trial, should the judge consider that such means of resolution were appropriate, when he is considering the appropriate costs order to make.\n\nThe party considering the case unsuitable for ADR shall, not less than 28 days before the commencement of the trial, file with the court a witness statement without prejudice save as to costs, giving reasons upon which they rely for saying that the case was unsuitable.\n\n4.11 If it appears that expert evidence will be required both on issues of liability and on the amount of damages, the court may direct that the exchange of those reports that relate to liability will be exchanged simultaneously but that those relating to the amount of damages will be exchanged sequentially.\n\n4.12\n\n(1) If it appears to the court that it cannot properly give directions on its own initiative and no agreed directions have been filed which it can approve, the court will direct a case management conference to be listed.\n\n(2) The conference will be listed as promptly as possible.\n\n4.13 Where the court is proposing on its own initiative to make an order under rule 35.7 (which gives the court power to direct that evidence on a particular issue is to be given by a single expert) or under rule 35.15 (which gives the court power to appoint an assessor), the court must, unless the parties have consented in writing to the order, list a case management conference.\n\n---\n\nCase management conferences\n\n5.1 The court will at any case management conference:\n\n(1) review the steps which the parties have taken in the preparation of the case, and in particular their compliance with any directions that the court may have given,\n\n(2) decide and give directions about the steps which are to be taken to secure the progress of the claim in accordance with the overriding objective, and\n\n(3) ensure as far as it can that all agreements that can be reached between the parties about the matters in issue and the conduct of the claim are made and recorded.\n\n5.2\n\n(1) Rule 29.3(2) provides that where a party has a legal representative, a representative familiar with the case and with sufficient authority to deal with any issues that are likely to arise must attend case management conferences and pre-trial reviews.\n\n(2) That person should be someone who is personally involved in the conduct of the case, and who has the authority and information to deal with any matter which may reasonably be expected to be dealt with at such a hearing, including the fixing of the timetable, the identification of issues and matters of evidence.\n\n(3) Where the inadequacy of the person attending or of his instructions leads to the adjournment of a hearing, the court will expect to make a wasted costs order.\n\n5.3 The topics the court will consider at a case management conference are likely to include:\n\n(1) whether the claimant has made clear the claim he is bringing, in particular the amount he is claiming, so that the other party can understand the case he has to meet,\n\n(2) whether any amendments are required to the claim, a statement of case or any other document,\n\n(3) what disclosure of documents, if any, is necessary,\n\n(4) what expert evidence is reasonably required in accordance with rule 35.1 and how and when that evidence should be obtained and disclosed,\n\n(5) what factual evidence should be disclosed,\n\n(6) what arrangements should be made about the giving of clarification or further information and the putting of questions to experts, and\n\n(7) whether it will be just and will save costs to order a split trial or the trial of one or more preliminary issues.\n\n5.4 In all cases the court will set a timetable for the steps it decides are necessary to be taken. These steps may include the holding of a case management conference or a pre-trial review, and the court will be alert to perform its duty to fix a trial date or period as soon as it can.\n\n5.5\n\n(1) The court will not at this stage give permission to use expert evidence unless it can identify each expert by name or field in its order and say whether his evidence is to be given orally or by the use of his report.\n\n(2) A party who obtains expert evidence before obtaining a direction about it does so at his own risk as to costs, except where he obtained the evidence in compliance with a pre-action protocol.\n\n5.6 To assist the court, the parties and their legal advisers should:\n\n(1) ensure that all documents that the court is likely to ask to see (including witness statements and experts' reports) are brought to the hearing,\n\n(2) consider whether the parties should attend,\n\n(3) consider whether a case summary will be useful, and\n\n(4) consider what orders each wishes to be made and give notice of them to the other parties.\n\n5.7\n\n(1) A case summary:\n\n(a) should be designed to assist the court to understand and deal with the questions before it,\n\n(b) should set out a brief chronology of the claim, the issues of fact which are agreed or in dispute and the evidence needed to decide them,\n\n(c) should not normally exceed 500 words in length, and\n\n(d) should be prepared by the claimant and agreed with the other parties if possible.\n\n5.8\n\n(1) Where a party wishes to obtain an order not routinely made at a case management conference and believes that his application will be opposed, he should issue and serve the application in time for it to be heard at the case management conference.\n\n(2) If the time allowed for the case management conference is likely to be insufficient for the application to be heard he should inform the court at once so that a fresh date can be fixed.\n\n(3) A costs sanction may be imposed on a party who fails to comply with sub-paragraph (1) or (2).\n\n5.9 At a case management conference the court may also consider whether the case ought to be tried by a High Court judge or by a judge who specialises in that type of claim and how that question will be decided. In that case the claim may need to be transferred to another court.\n\n---\n\nVariation of directions\n\n6.1 This paragraph deals with the procedure to be adopted:\n\n(1) where a party is dissatisfied with a direction given by the court,\n\n(2) where the parties have agreed about changes they wish made to the directions given, or\n\n(3) where a party wishes to apply to vary a direction.\n\n6.2\n\n(1) It is essential that any party who wishes to have a direction varied takes steps to do so as soon as possible.\n\n(2) The court will assume for the purposes of any later application that a party who did not appeal, and who made no application to vary within 14 days of service of the order containing the directions, was content that they were correct in the circumstances then existing.\n\n6.3\n\n(1) Where a party is dissatisfied with a direction given or other order made by the court he may appeal or apply to the court for it to reconsider its decision.\n\n(2) Unless paragraph 6.4 applies, a party should appeal if the direction was given or the order was made at a hearing at which he was present, or of which he had due notice.\n\n(3) In any other case he should apply to the court to reconsider its decision.\n\n(4) If an application is made for the court to reconsider its decision:\n\n(a) it will usually be heard by the judge who gave the directions or another judge of the same level,\n\n(b) the court will give all parties at least 3 days notice of the hearing, and\n\n(c) the court may confirm its directions or make a different order.\n\n6.4 Where there has been a change in the circumstances since the order was made the court may set aside or vary a direction it has given. It may do so on application or on its own initiative.\n\n6.5 Where the parties agree about changes they wish made to the directions given:\n\n(1) If rule 2.11 (variation by agreement of a date set by the court for doing any act other than those stated in the note to that rule), rule 3.8(4) (extensions of time by written agreement in circumstances within rule 3.8(3)) or rule 31.5, 31.10(8) or 31.13 (agreements about disclosure) applies the parties need not file the written agreement.\n\n(2)\n\n(a) In any other case the parties must apply for an order by consent.\n\n(b) The parties must file a draft of the order sought and an agreed statement of the reasons why the variation is sought.\n\n(c) The court may make an order in the agreed terms or in other terms without a hearing, but it may direct that a hearing is to be listed.\n\n---\n\nFailure to comply with case management directions\n\n7.1 Where a party fails to comply with a direction given by the court any other party may apply for an order that he must do so or for a sanction to be imposed or both of these.\n\n7.2 The party entitled to apply for such an order must do so without delay but should first warn the other party of his intention to do so.\n\n7.3 The court may take any such delay into account when it decides whether to make an order imposing a sanction or to grant relief from a sanction imposed by the rules or any other practice direction.\n\n7.4\n\n(1) The court will not allow a failure to comply with directions to lead to the postponement of the trial unless the circumstances are exceptional.\n\n(2) If it is practical to do so the court will exercise its powers in a manner that enables the case to come on for trial on the date or within the period previously set.\n\n(3) In particular the court will assess what steps each party should take to prepare the case for trial, direct that those steps are taken in the shortest possible time and impose a sanction for non-compliance. Such a sanction may, for example, deprive a party of the right to raise or contest an issue or to rely on evidence to which the direction relates.\n\n(4) Where it appears that one or more issues are or can be made ready for trial at the time fixed while others cannot, the court may direct that the trial will proceed on the issues which are then ready, and direct that no costs will be allowed for any later trial of the remaining issues or that those costs will be paid by the party in default.\n\n(5) Where the court has no option but to postpone the trial it will do so for the shortest possible time and will give directions for the taking of the necessary steps in the meantime as rapidly as possible.\n\n(6) Litigants and lawyers must be in no doubt that the court will regard the postponement of a trial as an order of last resort. Where it appears inevitable the court may exercise its power to require a party as well as his legal representative to attend court at the hearing where such an order is to be sought.\n\n(7) The court will not postpone any other hearing without a very good reason, and for that purpose the failure of a party to comply on time with directions previously given will not be treated as a good reason.\n\n---\n\nPre-trial check lists (listing questionnaires)\n\n8.1\n\n(1) The pre-trial check list (listing questionnaire) will be in Form N 170.\n\n(2) Unless it dispenses with pre-trial check lists and orders an early trial on a fixed date, the court will specify the date for filing completed pre-trial check lists when it fixes the trial date or trial period under rule 29.2(2).\n\n(3) The date for filing the completed pre-trial check list will be not later than 8 weeks before the trial date or the start of the trial period.\n\n(4) The court will serve the pre-trial check lists on the parties at least 14 days before that date.\n\n(5) Although the rules do not require the parties to exchange copies of the check lists before they are filed they are encouraged to do so to avoid the court being given conflicting or incomplete information.\n\n(6) The file will be placed before a judge for his directions when all the check lists have been filed or when the time for filing them has expired and where a party has filed a checklist but another party has not done so.\n\n8.2 The court's general approach will be as set out in the following paragraphs. The court may however decide to make other orders, and in particular the court will take into account the steps, if any, of which it is aware which the parties have taken to prepare the case for trial.\n\n8.3\n\n(1) Where no party files a pre-trial checklist the court will order that unless a completed pre-trial checklist is filed within 7 days from service of that order, the claim, defence and any counterclaim will be struck out without further order of the court.\n\n(2) Where a party files a pre-trial check list but another party (the defaulting party) does not do so, the court will fix a hearing under rule 29.6(4). Whether or not the defaulting party attends the hearing, the court will normally fix or confirm the trial date and make other orders about the steps to be taken to prepare the case for trial.\n\n8.4 Where the court decides to hold a hearing under rule 29.6(4) the court will fix a date which is as early as possible and the parties will be given at least 3 days notice of the date.\n\n8.5 Where the court decides to hold a pre-trial review (whether or not this is in addition to a hearing under rule 29.6(4)) the court will give the parties at least 7 days notice of the date.\n\n---\n\nDirections the court will give on listing\n\n9.1\n\n---\n\nDirections the court must give\n\nThe court must fix the trial date or week, give a time estimate and fix the place of trial.\n\n9.2\n\n---\n\nOther directions\n\n(1) The parties should seek to agree directions and may file an agreed order. The court may make an order in those terms or it may make a different order.\n\n(2) Agreed directions should include provision about:\n\n(a) evidence especially expert evidence,\n\n(b) a trial timetable and time estimate,\n\n(c) the preparation of a trial bundle, and\n\n(d) any other matter needed to prepare the case for trial.\n\n(3) The court will include such of these provisions as are appropriate in any order that it may make, whether or not the parties have filed agreed directions.\n\n(4) Unless a direction doing so has been given before, a direction giving permission to use expert evidence will say whether it gives permission to use oral evidence or reports or both and will name the experts concerned.\n\n9.3 The principles set out in paragraph 6 of this practice direction about variation of directions applies equally to directions given at this stage.\n\n---\n\nThe trial\n\n10.1 The trial will normally take place at a Civil Trial Centre but it may be at another court if it is appropriate having regard to the needs of the parties and the availability of court resources.\n\n10.2 The judge will generally have read the papers in the trial bundle and may dispense with an opening address.\n\n10.3 The judge may confirm or vary any timetable given previously, or if none has been given set his own.\n\n10.4 Attention is drawn to the provisions in Part 32 and the following parts of the Rules about evidence, and in particular:\n\n(1) to rule 32.1 (court's power to control evidence and to restrict cross-examination), and\n\n(2) to rule 32.5(2) statements and reports to stand as evidence in chief.\n\n10.5 In an appropriate case the judge may summarily assess costs in accordance with rule 44.6. Attention is drawn to the practice directions about costs and the steps the parties are required to take.\n\n10.6 Once the trial of a multi-track claim has begun, the judge will normally sit on consecutive court days until it has been concluded.",

    "content": "PART 30 - TRANSFER\n\n---\n\nContents of this Part\n\n---\n\nScope of this Part\n\n30.1\n\n(1) This Part deals with the transfer of proceedings within the County Court, between the High Court and the county courts and within the High Court.\n\n(2) Practice Direction 30 makes provision about the transfer of proceedings between the court and a tribunal.\n\n(Rule 26.2 provides for automatic transfer in certain cases)\n\n---\n\nTransfer within the County Court and the High Court\n\n30.2\n\n(1) In the County Court, a court may order that proceedings, or any part of them (such as a counterclaim or an application made in the proceedings), may be transferred to another County Court hearing centre if it is satisfied that -\n\n(a) an order should be made having regard to the criteria in rule 30.3; or\n\n(b) proceedings for -\n\n(i) the detailed assessment of costs; or\n\n(ii) the enforcement of a judgment or order,\n\ncould be more conveniently or fairly taken elsewhere.\n\n(2) If proceedings have been started in the wrong county court, a judge of the county court may order that the proceedings -\n\n(a) be transferred to the county court in which they ought to have been started;\n\n(b) continue in the county court in which they have been started; or\n\n(c) be struck out.\n\n(3) An application for an order under paragraph (1) or (2) must be made to the County Court hearing centre where the claim is proceeding.\n\n(4) The High Court may, having regard to the criteria in rule 30.3, order proceedings in the Royal Courts of Justice or a district registry, or any part of such proceedings (such as a counterclaim or an application made in the proceedings), to be transferred -\n\n(a) from the Royal Courts of Justice to a district registry; or\n\n(b) from a district registry to the Royal Courts of Justice or to another district registry.\n\n(5) A district registry may order proceedings before it for the detailed assessment of costs to be transferred to another district registry if it is satisfied that the proceedings could be more conveniently or fairly taken in that other district registry.\n\n(6) An application for an order under paragraph (4) or (5) must, if the claim is proceeding in a district registry, be made to that registry.\n\n(7) Where some enactment, other than these Rules, requires proceedings to be started by sending, or making, the claim or application to a particular County Court hearing centre, paragraph (1) does not give the court power to order proceedings to be transferred elsewhere.\n\n(8) Probate proceedings may only be transferred under paragraph (4) to the Chancery Division at the Royal Courts of Justice or to one of the Chancery district registries.\n\n---\n\nCriteria for a transfer order\n\n30.3\n\n(1) Paragraph (2) sets out the matters to which the court must have regard when considering whether to make an order under -\n\n(a) section 40(2), 41(1) or 42(2) of the County Courts Act 19841(transfer between the High Court and a county court);\n\n(b) rule 30.2(1) (transfer within the County Court);

or\n\n(iii) security;\n\n(g) whether the making of a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 has arisen or may arise;\n\n(h) in the case of civil proceedings by or against the Crown, as defined in rule 66.1(2), the location of the relevant government department or officers of the Crown and, where appropriate, any relevant public interest that the matter should be tried in London.\n\n(3) Where in proceedings in the County Court the court considers that there is a real possibility that a party would in the course of the proceedings be required to disclose material the disclosure of which would be damaging to the interests of national security, the court must transfer the proceedings to the High Court.\n\n---\n\nProcedure\n\n30.4\n\n(1) Where the court orders proceedings to be transferred, it will give notice of that transfer to all the parties.\n\n(2) An order made before the transfer of the proceedings shall not be affected by the order to transfer.\n\n(3) Where-\n\n(a) proceedings for the enforcement of a judgment or order for possession of land are transferred by the County Court to the High Court; and\n\n(b) the land which is the subject of the possession order is located within the area of a District Registry,\n\nthen, unless the court orders otherwise on or following transfer, the transfer shall be to that District Registry and all applications made in the High Court in relation to such transferred proceedings (including for any stay or suspension of any writ) shall be made in that District Registry.\n\n---\n\nTransfer between Divisions and to and from a specialist list\n\n30.5\n\n(1) The High Court may order proceedings in any Division of the High Court to be transferred to another Division.\n\n(2) A judge dealing with claims in a specialist list may order proceedings to be transferred to or from that list.\n\n(3) An application for the transfer of proceedings to or from a specialist list must be made to a judge dealing with claims in that list.\n\n(4) An order for transfer of proceedings between the Chancery Division and a King's Bench Division specialist list may only be made with the consent of the Chancellor of the High Court.\n\n---\n\nPower to specify place where hearings are to be held\n\n30.6 The court may specify the place (for instance, a particular County Court hearing centre) where the trial or some other hearing in any proceedings is to be held and may do so without ordering the proceedings to be transferred.\n\n(Practice Direction 54 D contains provisions about where hearings may be held in proceedings in the Administrative Court.)\n\n---\n\nTransfer of control of money in court\n\n30.7 The court may order that control of any money held by it under rule 21.11 (control of money recovered by or on behalf of a child or protected party) be transferred to another court or County Court hearing centre if that court or hearing centre would be more convenient.\n\n---\n\nTransfer of competition law claims\n\n30.8\n\n(1) This rule applies if, in any proceedings in the King's Bench Division, (other than proceedings in the Commercial or Admiralty Courts) a district registry of the High Court or a county court, a party's statement of case raises an issue relating to the application of of Chapter I or II of Part I of the Competition Act 19982 or to a claim under section 101 of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024.\n\n(2) Rules 30.2 and 30.3 do not apply.\n\n(3) The court must transfer the proceedings to the Chancery Division of the High Court at the Royal Courts of Justice.\n\n(4) If any such proceedings which have been commenced in the King's Bench Division or a Circuit Commercial Court fall within the scope of rule 58.1(2), any party to those proceedings may apply for the transfer of the proceedings to the Commercial Court, in accordance with rule 58.4(2) and rule 30.5(3).

but\n\n(b) he must state in his disclosure statement that inspection of those documents will not be permitted on the grounds that to do so would be disproportionate.\n\n(Rule 31.6 provides for standard disclosure)\n\n(Rule 31.10 makes provision for a disclosure statement)\n\n(Rule 31.12 provides for a party to apply for an order for specific inspection of documents)\n\n---\n\nMeaning of document\n\n31.4 In this Part -\n\n'document' means anything in which information of any description is recorded;

and\n\n(e) states which of the directions under paragraphs (7) or (8) are to be sought.\n\n(4) In cases where the Electronic Documents Questionnaire has been exchanged, the Questionnaire should be filed with the report required by paragraph (3).\n\n(5) Not less than seven days before the first case management conference, and on any other occasion as the court may direct, the parties must, at a meeting or by telephone, discuss and seek to agree a proposal in relation to disclosure that meets the overriding objective.\n\n(6) If -\n\n(a) the parties agree proposals for the scope of disclosure; and\n\n(b) the court considers that the proposals are appropriate in all the circumstances,\n\nthe court may approve them without a hearing and give directions in the terms proposed.\n\n(7) At the first or any subsequent case management conference, the court will decide, having regard to the overriding objective and the need to limit disclosure to that which is necessary to deal with the case justly, which of the following orders to make in relation to disclosure -\n\n(a) an order dispensing with disclosure;\n\n(b) an order that a party disclose the documents on which it relies, and at the same time request any specific disclosure it requires from any other party;\n\n(c) an order that directs, where practicable, the disclosure to be given by each party on an issue by issue basis;\n\n(d) an order that each party disclose any documents which it is reasonable to suppose may contain information which enables that party to advance its own case or to damage that of any other party, or which leads to an enquiry which has either of those consequences;\n\n(e) an order that a party give standard disclosure;\n\n(f) any other order in relation to disclosure that the court considers appropriate.\n\n(8) The court may at any point give directions as to how disclosure is to be given, and in particular -\n\n(a) what searches are to be undertaken, of where, for what, in respect of which time periods and by whom and the extent of any search for electronically stored documents;\n\n(b) whether lists of documents are required;\n\n(c) how and when the disclosure statement is to be given;\n\n(d) in what format documents are to be disclosed (and whether any identification is required);\n\n(e) what is required in relation to documents that once existed but no longer exist; and\n\n(f) whether disclosure shall take place in stages.\n\n(9) To the extent that the documents to be disclosed are electronic, the provisions of Practice Direction 31 B - Disclosure of Electronic Documents will apply in addition to paragraphs (3) to (8).\n\n---\n\nStandard disclosure - what documents are to be disclosed\n\n31.6 Standard disclosure requires a party to disclose only-\n\n(a) the documents on which he relies; and\n\n(b) the documents which -\n\n(i) adversely affect his own case;\n\n(ii) adversely affect another party's case; or\n\n(iii) support another party's case; and\n\n(c) the documents which he is required to disclose by a relevant practice direction.\n\n---\n\nDuty of search\n\n31.7\n\n(1) When giving standard disclosure, a party is required to make a reasonable search for documents falling within rule 31.6(b) or (c).\n\n(2) The factors relevant in deciding the reasonableness of a search include the following -\n\n(a) the number of documents involved;\n\n(b) the nature and complexity of the proceedings;\n\n(c) the ease and expense of retrieval of any particular document; and\n\n(d) the significance of any document which is likely to be located during the search.\n\n(3) Where a party has not searched for a category or class of document on the grounds that to do so would be unreasonable, he must state this in his disclosure statement and identify the category or class of document.\n\n(Rule 31.10 makes provision for a disclosure statement)\n\n---\n\nDuty of disclosure limited to documents which are or have been in a party's control\n\n31.8\n\n(1) A party's duty to disclose documents is limited to documents which are or have been in his control.\n\n(2) For this purpose a party has or has had a document in his control if -\n\n(a) it is or was in his physical possession;\n\n(b) he has or has had a right to possession of it;

and\n\n(b)\n\n(i) those documents which are no longer in the party's control; and\n\n(ii) what has happened to those documents.\n\n(Rule 31.19 (3) and (4) require a statement in the list of documents relating to any documents inspection of which a person claims he has a right or duty to withhold)\n\n(5) The list must include a disclosure statement.\n\n(6) A disclosure statement is a statement made by the party disclosing the documents -\n\n(a) setting out the extent of the search that has been made to locate documents which he is required to disclose;\n\n(b) certifying that he understands the duty to disclose documents; and\n\n(c) certifying that to the best of his knowledge he has carried out that duty.\n\n(7) Where the party making the disclosure statement is a company, firm, association or other organisation, the statement must also-\n\n(a) identify the person making the statement; and\n\n(b) explain why he is considered an appropriate person to make the statement.\n\n(8) The parties may agree in writing -\n\n(a) to disclose documents without making a list; and\n\n(b) to disclose documents without the disclosing party making a disclosure statement.\n\n(9) A disclosure statement may be made by a person who is not a party where this is permitted by a relevant practice direction.\n\n---\n\nDuty of disclosure continues during proceedings\n\n31.11\n\n(1) Any duty of disclosure continues until the proceedings are concluded.\n\n(2) If documents to which that duty extends come to a party's notice at any time during the proceedings, he must immediately notify every other party.\n\n---\n\nSpecific disclosure or inspection\n\n31.12\n\n(1) The court may make an order for specific disclosure or specific inspection.\n\n(2) An order for specific disclosure is an order that a party must do one or more of the following things -\n\n(a) disclose documents or classes of documents specified in the order;\n\n(b) carry out a search to the extent stated in the order;\n\n(c) disclose any documents located as a result of that search.\n\n(3) An order for specific inspection is an order that a party permit inspection of a document referred to in rule 31.3(2).\n\n(Rule 31.3(2) allows a party to state in his disclosure statement that he will not permit inspection of a document on the grounds that it would be disproportionate to do so)\n\n---\n\nDisclosure in stages\n\n31.13 The parties may agree in writing, or the court may direct, that disclosure or inspection or both shall take place in stages.\n\n---\n\nDocuments referred to in statements of case etc.\n\n31.14\n\n(1) A party may inspect a document mentioned in -\n\n(a) a statement of case;\n\n(b) a witness statement;\n\n(c) a witness summary; or\n\n(d) an affidavit(GL).\n\n(e) Revoked.\n\n(2) Subject to rule 35.10(4), a party may apply for an order for inspection of any document mentioned in an expert's report which has not already been disclosed in the proceedings.\n\n(Rule 35.10(4) makes provision in relation to instructions referred to in an expert's report)\n\n---\n\nInspection and copying of documents\n\n31.15 Where a party has a right to inspect a document-\n\n(a) that party must give the party who disclosed the document written notice of his wish to inspect it;\n\n(b) the party who disclosed the document must permit inspection not more than 7 days after the date on which he received the notice;

and\n\n(d) disclosure before proceedings have started is desirable in order to -\n\n(i) dispose fairly of the anticipated proceedings;\n\n(ii) assist the dispute to be resolved without proceedings; or\n\n(iii) save costs.\n\n(4) An order under this rule must -\n\n(a) specify the documents or the classes of documents which the respondent must disclose;

and\n\n(b) specify the time and place for disclosure and inspection.\n\n---\n\nOrders for disclosure against a person not a party\n\n31.17\n\n(1) This rule applies where an application is made to the court under any Act for disclosure by a person who is not a party to the proceedings 2.\n\n(2) The application must be supported by evidence.\n\n(3) The court may make an order under this rule only where-\n\n(a) the documents of which disclosure is sought are likely to support the case of the applicant or adversely affect the case of one of the other parties to the proceedings; and\n\n(b) disclosure is necessary in order to dispose fairly of the claim or to save costs.\n\n(4) An order under this rule must -\n\n(a) specify the documents or the classes of documents which the respondent must disclose; and\n\n(b) require the respondent, when making disclosure, to specify any of those documents -\n\n(i) which are no longer in his control; or\n\n(ii) in respect of which he claims a right or duty to withhold inspection.\n\n(5) Such an order may -\n\n(a) require the respondent to indicate what has happened to any documents which are no longer in his control; and\n\n(b) specify the time and place for disclosure and inspection.\n\n---\n\nRules not to limit other powers of the court to order disclosure\n\n31.18 Rules 31.16 and 31.17 do not limit any other power which the court may have to order -\n\n(a) disclosure before proceedings have started;

and\n\n(b) invite any person, whether or not a party, to make representations.\n\n(7) An application under paragraph (1) or paragraph (5) must be supported by evidence.\n\n(8) This Part does not affect any rule of law which permits or requires a document to be withheld from disclosure or inspection on the ground that its disclosure or inspection would damage the public interest.\n\n---\n\nRestriction on use of a privileged document inspection of which has been inadvertently allowed\n\n31.20 Where a party inadvertently allows a privileged(GL)document to be inspected, the party who has inspected the document may use it or its contents only with the permission of the court.\n\n---\n\nConsequence of failure to disclose documents or permit inspection\n\n31.21 A party may not rely on any document which he fails to disclose or in respect of which he fails to permit inspection unless the court gives permission.\n\n---\n\nSubsequent use of disclosed documents and completed Electronic Documents Questionnaires\n\n31.22\n\n(1) A party to whom a document has been disclosed may use the document only for the purpose of the proceedings in which it is disclosed, except where -\n\n(a) the document has been read to or by the court, or referred to, at a hearing which has been held in public;\n\n(b) the court gives permission; or\n\n(c) the party who disclosed the document and the person to whom the document belongs agree.\n\n(2) The court may make an order restricting or prohibiting the use of a document which has been disclosed, even where the document has been read to or by the court, or referred to, at a hearing which has been held in public.\n\n(3) An application for such an order may be made -\n\n(a) by a party; or\n\n(b) by any person to whom the document belongs.\n\n(4) For the purpose of this rule, an Electronic Documents Questionnaire which has been completed and served by another party pursuant to Practice Direction 31 B is to be treated as if it is a document which has been disclosed.\n\n---\n\nFalse disclosure statements\n\n31.23\n\n(1) Proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against a person if he makes, or causes to be made, a false disclosure statement, without an honest belief in its truth.\n\n(Part 81 deals with proceedings in relation to contempt of court.)\n\n2 Proceedings under this rule may be brought only - a by the Attorney General;

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 31 A - DISCLOSURE AND INSPECTION\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Part 31\n\nContents of this Practice Direction Para 8\n\n---\n\nGeneral\n\n1.1 In order to give standard disclosure the disclosing party must make a reasonable search for documents falling within the paragraphs of rule 31.6.\n\n1.2 Having made the search the disclosing party must (unless rule 31.10(8) applies) make a list of the documents of whose existence the party is aware that fall within those paragraphs and which are or have been in the party's control (see rule 31.8).\n\n1.3 The obligations imposed by an order for standard disclosure may be dispensed with or limited either by the court or by written agreement between the parties. Any such written agreement should be lodged with the court.\n\n---\n\nThe search\n\n2 The extent of the search which must be made will depend upon the circumstances of the case including, in particular, the factors referred to in rule 31.7(2). The parties should bear in mind the overriding principle of proportionality (see rule 1.1(2)(c)). It may, for example, be reasonable to decide not to search for documents coming into existence before some particular date, or to limit the search to documents in some particular place or places, or to documents falling into particular categories.\n\n---\n\nElectronic disclosure\n\n2 A.1 Rule 31.4 contains a broad definition of a document. This extends to electronic documents, including e-mail and other electronic communications, word processed documents and databases. In addition to documents that are readily accessible from computer systems and other electronic devices and media, the definition covers those documents that are stored on servers and back-up systems and electronic documents that have been'deleted'. It also extends to additional information stored and associated with electronic documents known as metadata.\n\n2 A.2 Practice Direction 31 B contains additional provisions in relation to the disclosure of electronic documents in cases that are likely to be allocated to the multi-track.\n\n---\n\nThe list\n\n3.1 The list should be in Form N 265.\n\n3.2 In order to comply with rule 31.10(3) it will normally be necessary to list the documents in date order, to number them consecutively and to give each a concise description (e.g. letter, claimant to defendant). Where there is a large number of documents all falling into a particular category the disclosing party may list those documents as a category rather than individually e.g. 50 bank statements relating to account number _ at _ Bank, _20_ to _20_; or, 35 letters passing between _ and _ between _20_ and _20_.\n\n3.3 The obligations imposed by an order for disclosure will continue until the proceedings come to an end. If, after a list of documents has been prepared and served, the existence of further documents to which the order applies comes to the attention of the disclosing party, the party must prepare and serve a supplemental list.\n\n---\n\nDisclosure statement\n\n4.1 A list of documents must (unless rule 31.10(8)(b) applies) contain a disclosure statement complying with rule 31.10. The form of disclosure statement is set out in the Annex to this practice direction.\n\n4.2 The disclosure statement should:\n\n(1) expressly state that the disclosing party believes the extent of the search to have been reasonable in all the circumstances, and\n\n(2) in setting out the extent of the search (see rule 31.10(6)) draw attention to any particular limitations on the extent of the search which were adopted for proportionality reasons and give the reasons why the limitations were adopted, e.g. the difficulty or expense that a search not subject to those limitations would have entailed or the marginal relevance of categories of documents omitted from the search.\n\n4.3 Where rule 31.10(7) applies, the details given in the disclosure statement about the person making the statement must include his name and address and the office or position he holds in the disclosing party or the basis upon which he makes the statement on behalf of the party.\n\n4.4 If the disclosing party has a legal representative acting for him, the legal representative must endeavour to ensure that the person making the disclosure statement (whether the disclosing party or, in a case to which rule 31.10(7) applies, some other person) understands the duty of disclosure under Part 31.\n\n4.5 If the disclosing party wishes to claim that he has a right or duty to withhold a document, or part of a document, in his list of documents from inspection (see rule 31.19(3)), he must state in writing:\n\n(1) that he has such a right or duty, and\n\n(2) the grounds on which he claims that right or duty.\n\n4.6 The statement referred to in paragraph 4.5 above should normally be included in the disclosure statement and must indicate the document, or part of a document, to which the claim relates.\n\n4.7 An insurer or the Motor Insurers' Bureau may sign a disclosure statement on behalf of a party where the insurer or the Motor Insurers' Bureau has a financial interest in the result of proceedings brought wholly or partially by or against that party. Rule 31.10(7) and paragraph 4.3 above shall apply to the insurer or the Motor Insurers' Bureau making such a statement.\n\n---\n\nSpecific disclosure\n\n5.1 If a party believes that the disclosure of documents given by a disclosing party is inadequate he may make an application for an order for specific disclosure (see rule 31.12).\n\n5.2 The application notice must specify the order that the applicant intends to ask the court to make and must be supported by evidence (see rule 31.12(2) which describes the orders the court may make).\n\n5.3 The grounds on which the order is sought may be set out in the application notice itself but if not there set out must be set out in the evidence filed in support of the application.\n\n5.4 In deciding whether or not to make an order for specific disclosure the court will take into account all the circumstances of the case and, in particular, the overriding objective described in Part 1. But if the court concludes that the party from whom specific disclosure is sought has failed adequately to comply with the obligations imposed by an order for disclosure (whether by failing to make a sufficient search for documents or otherwise) the court will usually make such order as is necessary to ensure that those obligations are properly complied with.\n\n5.5 An order for specific disclosure may in an appropriate case direct a party to -\n\n(1) carry out a search for any documents which it is reasonable to suppose may contain information which may-\n\n(a) enable the party applying for disclosure either to advance his own case or to damage that of the party giving disclosure; or\n\n(b) lead to a train of enquiry which has either of those consequences; and\n\n(2) disclose any documents found as a result of that search.\n\n---\n\nClaims to withhold disclosure or inspection of a document\n\n6.1 A claim to withhold inspection of a document, or part of a document, disclosed in a list of documents does not require an application to the court. Where such a claim has been made, a party who wishes to challenge it must apply to the court (see rule 31.19(5)).\n\n6.2 Rule 31.19(1) and (6) provide a procedure enabling a party to apply for an order permitting disclosure of the existence of a document to be withheld.\n\n---\n\nInspection of documents mentioned in expert's report (Rule 31.14(2))\n\n7.1 If a party wishes to inspect documents referred to in the expert report of another party, before issuing an application he should request inspection of the documents informally, and inspection should be provided by agreement unless the request is unreasonable.\n\n7.2 Where an expert report refers to a large number or volume of documents and it would be burdensome to copy or collate them, the court will only order inspection of such documents if it is satisfied that it is necessary for the just disposal of the proceedings and the party cannot reasonably obtain the documents from another source.\n\n---\n\nFalse disclosure statement\n\n8 Attention is drawn to rule 31.23 which sets out the consequences of making a false disclosure statement without an honest belief in its truth, and to the procedure set out in Part 81- Applications and proceedings in relation to contempt of court..\n\n---\n\nANNEX\n\nDisclosure statement\n\nI, the above named claimant [or defendant] [if party making disclosure is a company, firm or other organisation identify here who the person making the disclosure statement is and why he is the appropriate person to make it] state that I have carried out a reasonable and proportionate search to locate all the documents which I am required to disclose under the order made by the court on day of . I did not search:\n\n(1) for documents predating ……….,\n\n(2) for documents located elsewhere than ……….,\n\n(3) for documents in categories other than ………..\n\n(4) for electronic documents\n\nI carried out a search for electronic documents contained on or created by the following:\n\n[list what was searched and extent of search]\n\nI did not search for the following:\n\n(1) documents created before……….,\n\n(2) documents contained on or created by the Claimant's/Defendant's PCs/portable data storage media/databases/servers/back-up tapes/off-site storage/mobile phones/laptops/notebooks/handheld devices/PDA devices (delete as appropriate),\n\n(3) documents contained on or created by the Claimant's/Defendant's mail files/document files/calendar files/spreadsheet files/graphic and presentation files/web-based applications (delete as appropriate),\n\n(4) documents other than by reference to the following keyword(s)/concepts………. (delete if your search was not confined to specific keywords or concepts).\n\nI certify that I understand the duty of disclosure and to the best of my knowledge I have carried out that duty.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 31 B - DISCLOSURE OF ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Part 31\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nPurpose, scope and interpretation\n\n1 Rule 31.4 contains a broad definition of 'document'. This extends to Electronic Documents.\n\n2 The purpose of this Practice Direction is to encourage and assist the parties to reach agreement in relation to the disclosure of Electronic Documents in a proportionate and cost-effective manner.\n\n3 Unless the court orders otherwise, this Practice Direction only applies to proceedings that are (or are likely to be) allocated to the multi-track.\n\n4 Unless the court orders otherwise, this Practice Direction only applies to proceedings started on or after 1 st October 2010. Paragraph 2 A.2 to 2 A.5 of Practice Direction 31 A in force immediately before that date continues to apply to proceedings started before that date.\n\n5 In this Practice Direction -\n\n(1) 'Data Sampling' means the process of checking data by identifying and checking representative individual documents;\n\n(2) 'Disclosure Data' means data relating to disclosed documents, including for example the type of document, the date of the document, the names of the author or sender and the recipient, and the party disclosing the document;\n\n(3) 'Electronic Document' means any document held in electronic form. It includes, for example, email and other electronic communications such as text messages and voicemail, word-processed documents and databases, and documents stored on portable devices such as memory sticks and mobile phones. In addition to documents that are readily accessible from computer systems and other electronic devices and media, it includes documents that are stored on servers and back-up systems and documents that have been deleted. It also includes metadata and other embedded data which is not typically visible on screen or a print out;\n\n(4) 'Electronic Image' means an electronic representation of a paper document;\n\n(5) 'Electronic Documents Questionnaire' means the questionnaire in the Schedule to this Practice Direction;\n\n(6) 'Keyword Search' means a software-aided search for words across the text of an Electronic Document;\n\n(7) 'Metadata' is data about data. In the case of an Electronic Document, metadata is typically embedded information about the document which is not readily accessible once the Native Electronic Document has been converted into an Electronic Image or paper document. It may include (for example) the date and time of creation or modification of a word-processing file, or the author and the date and time of sending an email. Metadata may be created automatically by a computer system or manually by a user;\n\n(8) 'Native Electronic Document' or 'Native Format' means an Electronic Document stored in the original form in which it was created by a computer software program; and\n\n(9) 'Optical Character Recognition (OCR)' means the computer-facilitated recognition of printed or written text characters in an Electronic Image in which the text-based contents cannot be searched electronically.\n\n---\n\nGeneral principles\n\n6 When considering disclosure of Electronic Documents, the parties and their legal representatives should bear in mind the following general principles -\n\n(1) Electronic Documents should be managed efficiently in order to minimise the cost incurred;\n\n(2) technology should be used in order to ensure that document management activities are undertaken efficiently and effectively;\n\n(3) disclosure should be given in a manner which gives effect to the overriding objective;\n\n(4) Electronic Documents should generally be made available for inspection in a form which allows the party receiving the documents the same ability to access, search, review and display the documents as the party giving disclosure; and\n\n(5) disclosure of Electronic Documents which are of no relevance to the proceedings may place an excessive burden in time and cost on the party to whom disclosure is given.\n\n---\n\nPreservation of documents\n\n7 As soon as litigation is contemplated, the parties' legal representatives must notify their clients of the need to preserve disclosable documents. The documents to be preserved include Electronic Documents which would otherwise be deleted in accordance with a document retention policy or otherwise deleted in the ordinary course of business.\n\n---\n\nDiscussions between the parties before the first Case Management Conference in relation to the use of technology and disclosure\n\n8 The parties and their legal representatives must, before the first case management conference, discuss the use of technology in the management of Electronic Documents and the conduct of proceedings, in particular for the purpose of -\n\n(1) creating lists of documents to be disclosed;\n\n(2) giving disclosure by providing documents and information regarding documents in electronic format; and\n\n(3) presenting documents and other material to the court at the trial.\n\n9 The parties and their legal representatives must also, before the first case management conference, discuss the disclosure of Electronic Documents. In some cases (for example heavy and complex cases) it may be appropriate to begin discussions before proceedings are commenced. The discussions should include (where appropriate) the following matters -\n\n(1) the categories of Electronic Documents within the parties' control, the computer systems, electronic devices and media on which any relevant documents may be held, storage systems and document retention policies;\n\n(2) the scope of the reasonable search for Electronic Documents required by rule 31.7;\n\n(3) the tools and techniques (if any) which should be considered to reduce the burden and cost of disclosure of Electronic Documents, including -\n\n(a) limiting disclosure of documents or certain categories of documents to particular date ranges, to particular custodians of documents, or to particular types of documents;\n\n(b) the use of agreed Keyword Searches;\n\n(c) the use of agreed software tools;\n\n(d) the methods to be used to identify duplicate documents;\n\n(e) the use of Data Sampling;\n\n(f) the methods to be used to identify privileged documents and other non-disclosable documents, to redact documents (where redaction is appropriate), and for dealing with privileged or other documents which have been inadvertently disclosed; and\n\n(g) the use of a staged approach to the disclosure of Electronic Documents;\n\n(4) the preservation of Electronic Documents, with a view to preventing loss of such documents before the trial;\n\n(5) the exchange of data relating to Electronic Documents in an agreed electronic format using agreed fields;\n\n(6) the formats in which Electronic Documents are to be provided on inspection and the methods to be used;\n\n(7) the basis of charging for or sharing the cost of the provision of Electronic Documents, and whether any arrangements for charging or sharing of costs are final or are subject to re-allocation in accordance with any order for costs subsequently made; and\n\n(8) whether it would be appropriate to use the services of a neutral electronic repository for storage of Electronic Documents.\n\n---\n\nThe Electronic Documents Questionnaire\n\n10 In some cases the parties may find it helpful to exchange the Electronic Documents Questionnaire in order to provide information to each other in relation to the scope, extent and most suitable format for disclosure of Electronic Documents in the proceedings.\n\n11 The answers to the Electronic Documents Questionnaire must be verified by a statement of truth.\n\n12 Answers to the Electronic Documents Questionnaire will only be available for inspection by non-parties if permission is given under rule 5.4 C(2).\n\n13 Rule 31.22 makes provision regulating the use of answers to the Electronic Documents Questionnaire.\n\n---\n\nPreparation for the first Case Management Conference\n\n14 The documents submitted to the court in advance of the first case management conference should include a summary of the matters on which the parties agree in relation to the disclosure of Electronic Documents and a summary of the matters on which they disagree.\n\n15 If the parties indicate that they have been unable to reach agreement in relation to the disclosure of Electronic Documents and that no agreement is likely, the court will give written directions in relation to disclosure or order a separate hearing in relation to disclosure. When doing so, the court will consider making an order that the parties must complete and exchange all or any part of the Electronic Documents Questionnaire within 14 days or such other period as the court may direct.\n\n16 The person signing the Electronic Documents Questionnaire should attend the first case management conference, and any subsequent hearing at which disclosure is likely to be considered.\n\n---\n\nWhere the parties are unable to reach an appropriate agreement in relation to the disclosure of Electronic Documents\n\n17 If at any time it becomes apparent that the parties are unable to reach agreement in relation to the disclosure of Electronic Documents, the parties should seek directions from the court at the earliest practical date.\n\n18 If the court considers that the parties' agreement in relation to the disclosure of Electronic Documents is inappropriate or insufficient, the court will give directions in relation to disclosure. When doing so, the court will consider making an order that the parties must complete and exchange all or any part of the Electronic Documents Questionnaire within 14 days or such other period as the court may direct.\n\n19 If a party gives disclosure of Electronic Documents without first discussing with other parties how to plan and manage such disclosure, the court may require that party to carry out further searches for documents or to repeat other steps which that party has already carried out.\n\n---\n\nThe reasonable search\n\n20 The extent of the reasonable search required by rule 31.7 for the purposes of standard disclosure is affected by the existence of Electronic Documents. The extent of the search which must be made will depend on the circumstances of the case including, in particular, the factors referred to in rule 31.7(2). The parties should bear in mind that the overriding objective includes dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate.\n\n21 The factors that may be relevant in deciding the reasonableness of a search for Electronic Documents include (but are not limited to) the following -\n\n(1) the number of documents involved;\n\n(2) the nature and complexity of the proceedings;\n\n(3) the ease and expense of retrieval of any particular document. This includes:\n\n(a) the accessibility of Electronic Documents including e-mail communications on computer systems, servers, back-up systems and other electronic devices or media that may contain such documents taking into account alterations or developments in hardware or software systems used by the disclosing party and/or available to enable access to such documents;\n\n(b) the location of relevant Electronic Documents, data, computer systems, servers, back-up systems and other electronic devices or media that may contain such documents;\n\n(c) the likelihood of locating relevant data;\n\n(d) the cost of recovering any Electronic Documents;\n\n(e) the cost of disclosing and providing inspection of any relevant Electronic Documents; and\n\n(f) the likelihood that Electronic Documents will be materially altered in the course of recovery, disclosure or inspection;\n\n(4) the availability of documents or contents of documents from other sources; and\n\n(5) the significance of any document which is likely to be located during the search.\n\n22 Depending on the circumstances, it may be reasonable to search all of the parties' electronic storage systems, or to search only some part of those systems. For example, it may be reasonable to decide not to search for documents coming into existence before a particular date, or to limit the search to documents in a particular place or places, or to documents falling into particular categories.\n\n23 In some cases a staged approach may be appropriate, with disclosure initially being given of limited categories of documents. Those categories may subsequently be extended or limited depending on the results initially obtained.\n\n24 The primary source of disclosure of Electronic Documents is normally reasonably accessible data. A party requesting under rule 31.12 specific disclosure of Electronic Documents which are not reasonably accessible must demonstrate that the relevance and materiality justify the cost and burden of retrieving and producing it.\n\n---\n\nKeyword and other automated searches\n\n25 It may be reasonable to search for Electronic Documents by means of Keyword Searches or other automated methods of searching if a full review of each and every document would be unreasonable.\n\n26 However, it will often be insufficient to use simple Keyword Searches or other automated methods of searching alone. The injudicious use of Keyword Searches and other automated search techniques -\n\n(1) may result in failure to find important documents which ought to be disclosed, and/or\n\n(2) may find excessive quantities of irrelevant documents, which if disclosed would place an excessive burden in time and cost on the party to whom disclosure is given.\n\n27 The parties should consider supplementing Keyword Searches and other automated searches with additional techniques such as individually reviewing certain documents or categories of documents (for example important documents generated by key personnel) and taking such other steps as may be required in order to justify the selection to the court.\n\n---\n\nDisclosure of metadata\n\n28 Where copies of disclosed documents are provided in Native Format in accordance with paragraph 33 below, some metadata will be disclosed with each document. A party requesting disclosure of additional metadata or forensic image copies of disclosed documents (for example in relation to a dispute concerning authenticity) must demonstrate that the relevance and materiality of the requested metadata justify the cost and burden of producing that metadata.\n\n29 Parties using document management or litigation support systems should be alert to the possibility that Metadata or other useful information relating to documents may not be stored with the documents.\n\n---\n\nLists of documents\n\n30 If a party is giving disclosure of Electronic Documents, paragraph 3 of Practice Direction 31 A is to be read subject to the following -\n\n(1) Form N 265 may be amended to accommodate the sub-paragraphs which follow;\n\n(2) a list of documents may by agreement between the parties be an electronic file in .csv (comma-separated values) or other agreed format;\n\n(3) documents may be listed otherwise than in date order where a different order would be more convenient;\n\n(4) save where otherwise agreed or ordered, documents should be listed individually if a party already possesses data relating to the document (for example, type of document and date of creation) which make this possible (so that as far as possible each document may be given a unique reference number);\n\n(5) a party should be consistent in the way in which documents are listed;\n\n(6) consistent column headings should be repeated on each page of the list on which documents are listed, where the software used for preparing the list enables this to be carried out automatically; and\n\n(7) the disclosure list number used in any supplemental list of documents should be unique and should run sequentially from the last number used in the previous list.\n\n---\n\nProvision of disclosure data in electronic form\n\n31 Where a party provides another party with disclosure data in electronic form, the following provisions will apply unless the parties agree or the court directs otherwise -\n\n(1) Disclosure data should be set out in a single, continuous table or spreadsheet, each separate column containing exclusively one of the following types of disclosure data -\n\n(a) disclosure list number (sequential)\n\n(b) date\n\n(c) document type\n\n(d) author/sender\n\n(e) recipient\n\n(f) disclosure list number of any parent or covering document;\n\n(2) other than for disclosure list numbers, blank entries are permissible and preferred if there is no relevant disclosure data (that is, the field should be left blank rather than state 'Undated');\n\n(3) dates should be set out in the alphanumeric form '01 Jan 2010'; and\n\n(4) Disclosure data should be set out in a consistent manner.\n\n---\n\nProvision of electronic copies of disclosed documents\n\n32 The parties should co-operate at an early stage about the format in which Electronic Documents are to be provided on inspection. In the case of difficulty or disagreement, the matter should be referred to the court for directions at the earliest practical date, if possible at the first case management conference.\n\n33 Save where otherwise agreed or ordered, electronic copies of disclosed documents should be provided in their Native Format, in a manner which preserves Metadata relating to the date of creation of each document.\n\n34 A party should provide any available searchable OCR versions of Electronic Documents with the original. A party may however choose not to provide OCR versions of documents which have been redacted. If OCR versions are provided, they are provided on an 'as is' basis, with no assurance to the other party that the OCR versions are complete or accurate.\n\n(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2) below, if a party is providing in electronic form copies of disclosed documents and wishes to redact or otherwise make alterations to a document or documents, then -\n\n(a) the party redacting or altering the document must inform the other party in accordance with rule 31.19 that redacted or altered versions are being supplied; and\n\n(b) the party redacting or altering the document must ensure that the original unredacted and unaltered version is preserved, so that it remains available to be inspected if required.\n\n(2) Sub-paragraph (1) above does not apply where the only alteration made to the document is an alteration to the Metadata as a result of the ordinary process of copying and/or accessing the document. Sub-paragraph (1) does apply to the alteration or suppression of Metadata in other situations.\n\n---\n\nSpecialised technology\n\n36 If Electronic Documents are best accessed using technology which is not readily available to the party entitled to disclosure, and that party reasonably requires additional inspection facilities, the party making disclosure shall co-operate in making available to the other party such reasonable additional inspection facilities as may be appropriate in order to afford inspection in accordance with rule 31.3.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\n---\n\nElectronic Documents Questionnaire\n\nPart 1 - Your disclosure\n\n---\n\nExtent of a reasonable search\n\nDate range and custodians\n\n1.

Do you at this stage have any proposals about the Keyword Searches, or other automated searches, which should be applied by other parties to their document sets? If so, provide details.\n\n---\n\nInspection\n\n22. Subject to re-consideration after receiving the responses of other parties to this Electronic Documents Questionnaire, (a) in what format and (b) on what media do you wish to receive copies of disclosed documents which are or will be available in electronic form?\n\n23. Subject to re-consideration after receiving the responses of other parties to this Electronic Documents Questionnaire, do you wish to receive Disclosure Data electronically, and if so, (a) in what format and (b) on what media?\n\n---\n\nSTATEMENT OF TRUTH\n\n*[I believe][The [claimant][defendant] believes] that the facts stated in the answers to this Electronic Documents Questionnaire are true.\n\n\"[I understand] [The [claimant] [defendant] understands] that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.\n\n*I am duly authorised by the [claimant][defendant] to sign this statement.\n\nFull name____________________________________\n\nName of legal representative's firm_______________\n\nSigned ______________________________________\n\nPosition or office held (if signing on behalf of firm or company) _______________\n\nDate ________________\n\n* delete as appropriate\n\nWARNING: Unless the court makes some other order, the answers given in this document may only be used for the purposes of the proceedings in which the document is produced unless it has been read to or by the court or referred to at a hearing which has been held in public or the Court gives permission or the party who has completed this questionnaire agrees.\n\n---\n\nGuidance Notes:\n\n1. Technical expressions are defined in Practice Direction 31 B.\n\n2. The questions in the Electronic Documents Questionnaire are not intended to give rise to any implication about how disclosure should or should not be carried out. They are intended only to provide information to other parties and to the court.\n\n3. Further facts and matters may come to parties' attention over the course of the proceedings which affect the answers to the Electronic Documents Questionnaire. Where detailed information is not yet available at the time the Electronic Documents Questionnaire is first answered, parties should give such information as they can, and supplement or amend their answers when further information is available. Answers should be updated by notifying other parties and the court without undue delay, and in any event before each case management conference at which disclosure is likely to be considered.\n\n4. Some of the questions in the Electronic Documents Questionnaire require only a brief answer which may need to be elaborated after Electronic Documents Questionnaires have been exchanged. The purpose of such questions is to assist the parties in identifying the points which may require elaboration in order for meaningful discussions to take place between them.\n\n5. Questions which refer to sources of Electronic Documents that are not considered to be relevant may be answered with a statement to that effect.\n\n6. Questions about 'your' documents and about software, hardware or systems used by 'you' are directed, in the case of solicitors, to the solicitor's lay client's documents or to documents prepared on the lay client's behalf.\n\n---\n\nFootnotes\n\n• Include names of all those who may have or have had custody of disclosable documents, including secretaries, personal assistants, former employees and/or former participants. It may be helpful to identify different dates for particular custodians. • State the geographical location (if known).

    "content": "Document: Practice Direction 32\nSection: ANNEX 3\nPart 1 of 4\n==================================================\nPRACTICE DIRECTION 32 - EVIDENCE\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Part 32\n\nContents of this Practice Direction EVIDENCE IN GENERAL\n\n1.1 Rule 32.2 sets out how evidence is to be given and facts are to be proved.\n\n1.2 Evidence at a hearing other than the trial should normally be given by witness statement 1(see paragraph 17 onwards). However a witness may give evidence by affidavit if he wishes to do so 2(and see paragraph 1.4 below).\n\n1.3 Statements of case (see paragraph 26 onwards) and application notices 3 may also be used as evidence provided that their contents have been verified by a statement of truth 4.\n\n(For information regarding evidence by deposition see Part 34 and Practice Direction 34 A.)\n\n1.4 Affidavits must be used as evidence in the following instances:\n\n(1) where sworn evidence is required by an enactment 5,rule, order or practice direction, and\n\n(2) in any application for a search order, a freezing injunction, or an order requiring an occupier to permit another to enter his land.\n\n(By rule 81.4(1), unless and to the extent that the court directs otherwise every contempt application must be supported by written evidence given by affidavit or affirmation.).\n\n1.5 If a party believes that sworn evidence is required by a court in another jurisdiction for any purpose connected with the proceedings, he may apply to the court for a direction that evidence shall be given only by affidavit on any pre-trial applications.\n\n1.6 The court may give a direction under rule 32.15 that evidence shall be given by affidavit instead of or in addition to a witness statement or statement of case:\n\n(1) on its own initiative, or\n\n(2) after any party has applied to the court for such a direction.\n\n1.7 An affidavit, where referred to in the Civil Procedure Rules or a practice direction, also means an affirmation unless the context requires otherwise. AFFIDAVITS\n\nDeponent\n\n2 A deponent is a person who gives evidence by affidavit or affirmation. Heading\n\n3.1 The affidavit should be headed with the title of the proceedings (see paragraph 4 of Practice Direction 7 A and paragraph 5 of Practice Direction 20); where the proceedings are between several parties with the same status it is sufficient to identify the parties as follows:\n\n3.2 At the top right hand corner of the first page (and on the backsheet) there should be clearly written:\n\n(1) the party on whose behalf it is made,\n\n(2) the initials and surname of the deponent,\n\n(3) the number of the affidavit in relation to that deponent,\n\n(4) the identifying initials and number of each exhibit referred to, and\n\n(5) the date sworn. Body of affidavit\n\n4.1 The affidavit must, if practicable, be in the deponent's own words, the affidavit should be expressed in the first person and the deponent should:\n\n(1) commence 'I (full name) of (address) state on oath ……',\n\n(2) if giving evidence in his professional, business or other occupational capacity, give the address at which he works in (1) above, the position he holds and the name of his firm or employer,\n\n(3) give his occupation or, if he has none, his description, and\n\n(4) state if he is a party to the proceedings or employed by a party to the proceedings, if it be the case.\n\n4.2 An affidavit must indicate:\n\n(1) which of the statements in it are made from the deponent's own knowledge and which are matters of information or belief, and\n\n(2) the source for any matters of information or belief.\n\n4.3 Where a deponent:\n\n(1) refers to an exhibit or exhibits, he should state'there is now shown to me marked '…' the (description of exhibit)', and\n\n(2) makes more than one affidavit (to which there are exhibits) in the same proceedings, the numbering of the exhibits should run consecutively throughout and not start again with each affidavit. Jurat\n\n5.1 The jurat of an affidavit is a statement set out at the end of the document which authenticates the affidavit.\n\n5.2 It must:\n\n(1) be signed by all deponents,\n\n(2) be completed and signed by the person before whom the affidavit was sworn whose name and qualification must be printed beneath his signature,\n\n(3) contain the full address of the person before whom the affidavit was sworn, and\n\n(4) follow immediately on from the text and not be put on a separate page. Format of affidavits\n\n6.1 An affidavit should:\n\n(1) be produced on durable quality A 4 paper with a 3.5 cm margin,\n\n(2) be fully legible and should normally be typed on one side of the paper only,\n\n(3) where possible, be bound securely in a manner which would not hamper filing, or otherwise each page should be endorsed with the case number and should bear the initials of the deponent and of the person before whom it was sworn,\n\n(4) have the pages numbered consecutively as a separate document (or as one of several documents contained in a file),\n\n(5) be divided into numbered paragraphs,\n\n(6) have all numbers, including dates, expressed in figures, and\n\n(7) give the reference to any document or documents mentioned either in the margin or in bold text in the body of the affidavit.\n\n6.2 It is usually convenient for an affidavit to follow the chronological sequence of events or matters dealt with; each paragraph of an affidavit should as far as possible be confined to a distinct portion of the subject. Inability of Deponent to read or sign affidavit\n\n7.1 Where an affidavit is sworn by a person who is unable to read or sign it, the person before whom the affidavit is sworn must certify in the jurat that:\n\n(1) he read the affidavit to the deponent,\n\n(2) the deponent appeared to understand it, and\n\n(3) the deponent signed or made his mark, in his presence.\n\n7.2 If that certificate is not included in the jurat, the affidavit may not be used in evidence unless the court is satisfied that it was read to the deponent and that he appeared to understand it. Two versions of the form of jurat with the certificate are set out at Annex 1 to this practice direction. Alterations to affidavits\n\n8.1 Any alteration to an affidavit must be initialled by both the deponent and the person before whom the affidavit was sworn.\n\n8.2 An affidavit which contains an alteration that has not been initialled may be filed or used in evidence only with the permission of the court. Who may administer oaths and take affidavits\n\n9.1 Only the following may administer oaths and take affidavits -\n\n(1) a commissioner for oaths 6;\n\n(2) omitted;\n\n(3) other persons specified by statute 7;\n\n(4) certain officials of the Senior Courts 8;\n\n(5) a circuit judge or district judge 9;\n\n(6) any justice of the peace 10;and\n\n(7) certain officials of any county court appointed by the judge of that court for the purpose 11.\n\n9.2 An affidavit must be sworn before a person independent of the parties or their representatives. Filing of affidavits\n\n10.1 If the court directs that an affidavit is to be filed 12,it must be filed in the court or Division, or Office or Registry of the court or Division where the action in which it was or is to be used, is proceeding or will proceed.\n\n10.2 Where an affidavit is in a foreign language:\n\n(1) the party wishing to rely on it -\n\n(a) must have it translated, and\n\n(b) must file the foreign language affidavit with the court, and\n\n(2) the translator must make and file with the court an affidavit verifying the translation and exhibiting both the translation and a copy of the foreign language affidavit. EXHIBITS Manner of exhibiting documents\n\n11.1 A document used in conjunction with an affidavit should be:\n\n(1) produced to and verified by the deponent, and remain separate from the affidavit, and\n\n(2) identified by a declaration of the person before whom the affidavit was sworn.\n\n11.2 The declaration should be headed with the name of the proceedings in the same way as the affidavit.\n\n11.3 The first page of each exhibit should be marked:\n\n(1) as in paragraph 3.2 above, and\n\n(2) with the exhibit mark referred to in the affidavit. Letters\n\n12.1 Copies of individual letters should be collected together and exhibited in a bundle or bundles. They should be arranged in chronological order with the earliest at the top, and firmly secured.\n\n12.2 When a bundle of correspondence is exhibited, the exhibit should have a front page attached stating that the bundle consists of original letters and copies. They should be arranged and secured as above and numbered consecutively. Other documents\n\n13.1 Photocopies instead of original documents may be exhibited provided the originals are made available for inspection by the other parties before the hearing and by the judge at the hearing.\n\n13.2 Court documents must not be exhibited (official copies of such documents prove themselves).\n\n13.3 Where an exhibit contains more than one document, a front page should be attached setting out a list of the documents contained in the exhibit; the list should contain the dates of the documents. Exhibits other than documents\n\n14.1 Items other than documents should be clearly marked with an exhibit number or letter in such a manner that the mark cannot become detached from the exhibit.\n\n14.2 Small items may be placed in a container and the container appropriately marked. General provisions\n\n15.1 Where an exhibit contains more than one document:\n\n(1) the bundle should not be stapled but should be securely fastened in a way that does not hinder the reading of the documents, and\n\n(2) the pages should be numbered consecutively at bottom centre.\n\n15.2 Every page of an exhibit should be clearly legible; typed copies of illegible documents should be included, paginated with 'a' numbers.\n\n15.3 Where affidavits and exhibits have become numerous, they should be put into separate bundles and the pages numbered consecutively throughout.\n\n15.4 Where on account of their bulk the service of exhibits or copies of exhibits on the other parties would be difficult or impracticable, the directions of the court should be sought as to arrangements for bringing the exhibits to the attention of the other parties and as to their custody pending trial. Affirmations\n\n16 All provisions in this or any other practice direction relating to affidavits apply to affirmations with the following exceptions:\n\n(1) the deponent should commence 'I (name) of (address) do solemnly and sincerely affirm ……', and\n\n(2) in the jurat the word 'sworn' is replaced by the word 'affirmed'.\n\nWITNESS STATEMENTS Heading\n\n17.1 The witness statement should be headed with the title of the proceedings (see paragraph 4 of Practice Direction 7 A and paragraph 5 of Practice Direction 20); where the proceedings are between several parties with the same status it is sufficient to identify the parties as follows:\n\n17.2 At the top right hand corner of the first page there should be clearly written:\n\n(1) the party on whose behalf it is made,\n\n(2) the initials and surname of the witness,\n\n(3) the number of the statement in relation to that witness,\n\n(4) the identifying initials and number of each exhibit referred to,\n\n(5) the date the statement was made; and\n\n(6) the date of any translation. Body of witness statement\n\n18.1 The witness statement must, if practicable, be in the intended witness's own words and must in any event be drafted in their own language, the statement should be expressed in the first person and should also state:\n\n(1) the full name of the witness,\n\n(2) his place of residence or, if he is making the statement in his professional, business or other occupational capacity, the address at which he works, the position he holds and the name of his firm or employer,\n\n(3) his occupation, or if he has none, his description,\n\n(4) the fact that he is a party to the proceedings or is the employee of such a party if it be the case; and\n\n(5) the process by which it has been prepared, for example, face-to-face, over the telephone, and/or through an interpreter.\n\n18.2 A witness statement must indicate:\n\n(1) which of the statements in it are made from the witness's own knowledge and which are matters of information or belief, and\n\n(2) the source for any matters of information or belief.\n\n18.3 An exhibit used in conjunction with a witness statement should be verified and identified by the witness and remain separate from the witness statement.\n\n18.4 Where a witness refers to an exhibit or exhibits, he should state 'I refer to the (description of exhibit) marked'…''.\n\n18.5 The provisions of paragraphs 11.3 to 15.4 (exhibits) apply similarly to witness statements as they do to affidavits.\n\n18.6 Where a witness makes more than one witness statement to which there are exhibits, in the same proceedings, the numbering of the exhibits should run consecutively throughout and not start again with each witness statement. Format of witness statement\n\n19.1 A witness statement should:\n\n(1) be produced on durable quality A 4 paper with a 3.5 cm margin,\n\n(2) be fully legible and should normally be typed on one side of the paper only,\n\n(3) where possible, be bound securely in a manner which would not hamper filing, or otherwise each page should be endorsed with the case number and should bear the initials of the witness,\n\n(4) have the pages numbered consecutively as a separate statement (or as one of several statements contained in a file),\n\n(5) be divided into numbered paragraphs,\n\n(6) have all numbers, including dates, expressed in figures,\n\n(7) give the reference to any document or documents mentioned either in the margin or in bold text in the body of the statement ; and\n\n(8) be drafted in the witness's own language.\n\n19.2 It is usually convenient for a witness statement to follow the chronological sequence of the events or matters dealt with, each paragraph of a witness statement should as far as possible be confined to a distinct portion of the subject. Statement of Truth\n\n20.1 A witness statement is the equivalent of the oral evidence which that witness would, if called, give in evidence; it must include a statement by the intended witness in their own language that they believe the facts in it are true 13.\n\n20.2 To verify a witness statement the statement of truth is as follows:\n\n'I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true. I understand that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.'\n\n20.3 Attention is drawn to rule 32.14 which sets out the consequences of verifying a witness statement containing a false statement without an honest belief in its truth.\n\n(Rule 22.1(9) sets out the procedure to be followed where the person who should sign a document which is verified by a statement of truth is unable to read or sign the document other than by reason of language alone.)\n\n21 Omitted Alterations to witness statements\n\n22.1 Any alteration to a witness statement must be initialled by the person making the statement or by the authorised person where appropriate (see paragraph 21).\n\n22.2 A witness statement which contains an alteration that has not been initialled may be used in evidence only with the permission of the court. Filing of witness statements\n\n23.1 If the court directs that a witness statement is to be filed 14,it must be filed in the court or Division, or Office or Registry of the court or Division where the action in which it was or is to be used, is proceeding or will proceed.\n\n23.2 Where a witness statement is in a foreign language-\n\n(a) the party wishing to rely on it must-\n\n(i) have it translated; and\n\n(ii) file the foreign language witness statement with the court; and\n\n(b) the translator must sign the original statement and must certify that the translation is accurate. Certificate of court officer\n\n24.1 Where the court has ordered that a witness statement is not to be open to inspection by the public 15 or that words or passages in the statement are not to be open to inspection 16 the court officer will so certify on the statement and make any deletions directed by the court under rule 32.13(4). Defects in affidavits, witness statements and exhibits\n\n25.1 Where:\n\n(1) an affidavit,\n\n(2) a witness statement, or\n\n(3) an exhibit to either an affidavit or a witness statement,\n\ndoes not comply with Part 32 or this practice direction in relation to its form, the court may refuse to admit it as evidence and may refuse to allow the costs arising from its preparation.\n\n25.2 Permission to file a defective affidavit or witness statement or to use a defective exhibit may be obtained from a judge 17 in the court where the case is proceeding. STATEMENTS OF CASE\n\n26.1 A statement of case may be used as evidence in an interim application provided it is verified by a statement of truth 18.\n\n26.2 To verify a statement of case the statement of truth should be set out as follows:\n\n'[I believe][the (party on whose behalf the statement of case is being signed) believes] that the facts stated in the statement of case are true'.\n\n26.3 Attention is drawn to rule 32.14 which sets out the consequences of verifying a witness statement containing a false statement without an honest belief in its truth.\n\n(For information regarding statements of truth see Part 22 and Practice Direction 22.)\n\n(Practice Directions 7 A and 17 provide further information concerning statements of case.) AGREED BUNDLES FOR HEARINGS\n\n27.1 The court may give directions requiring the parties to use their best endeavours to agree a bundle or bundles of documents for use at any hearing.\n\n27.2 All documents contained in bundles which have been agreed for use at a hearing shall be admissible at that hearing as evidence of their contents, unless -\n\n(1) the court orders otherwise; or\n\n(2) a party gives written notice of objection to the admissibility of particular documents.\n\n27.3 Rule 39.5 provides that unless the court orders otherwise, the claimant must file a trial bundle containing documents required by-\n\n(a) a relevant practice direction; and\n\n(b) any court order.\n\n27.4 Rule 39.5 provides that the claimant must file the trial bundle not more than 7 days and not less than 3 days before the start of the trial.\n\n27.4 AIf the trial is to take place in the Family Division, then Practice Direction 27 A supplementing the Family Procedure Rules 2010 shall apply to provide what must happen in relation to the trial bundle in place of paragraphs 27.5 to 27.15 below.\n\n27.5 Unless the court orders otherwise, the trial bundle should include a copy of-\n\n(a) the claim form and all statements of case;\n\n(b) a case summary and/or chronology where appropriate;\n\n(c) requests for further information and responses to the requests;\n\n(d) all witness statements to be relied on as evidence;\n\n(e) any witness summaries;\n\n(f) any notices of intention to rely on hearsay evidence under rule 32.2;\n\n(g) any notices of intention to rely on evidence (such as a plan, photograph etc.) under rule 33.6 which is not-\n\n(i) contained in a witness statement, affidavit or experts' report;\n\n(ii) being given orally at trial; and\n\n(iii) hearsay evidence under rule 33.2;\n\n(h) any medical reports and responses to them;\n\n(i) any experts' reports and responses to them;\n\n(j) any order giving directions as to the conduct of the trial; and\n\n(k) any other necessary documents.\n\n27.6 The originals of the documents contained in the trial bundle, together with copies of any other court orders should be available at the trial.\n\n27.7 The preparation and production of the trial bundle, even where it is delegated to another person, is the responsibility of the legal representative who has conduct of the claim on behalf of the claimant. If the claimant is unrepresented, the court may direct that another party must prepare and produce the trial bundle.\n\n27.8 The trial bundle should be paginated (continuously) throughout, and indexed with a description of each document and the page number. Where the total number of pages is more than 100, numbered dividers should be placed at intervals between groups of documents.\n\n27.9 The bundle should normally be contained in a ring binder or lever arch file. Where more than one bundle is supplied, they should be clearly distinguishable, for example, by different colours or letters. If there are numerous bundles, a core bundle should be prepared containing the core documents essential to the proceedings, with references to the supplementary documents in the other bundles.\n\n27.10 For convenience, experts' reports may be contained in a separate bundle and cross referenced in the main bundle.\n\n27.11 If a document to be included in the trial bundle is illegible, a typed copy should be included in the bundle next to it, suitably cross-referenced.\n\n27.12 The contents of the trial bundle should be agreed where possible. The parties should also agree where possible-\n\n(a) that the documents contained in the bundle are authentic even if not disclosed under Part 31; and\n\n(b) that documents in the bundle may be treated as evidence of the facts stated in them even if a notice under the Civil Evidence Act 1995 has not been served.",

(Witness must sign). ANNEX 2\n\nOmitted\n\nANNEX 3\n\nVIDEO CONFERENCING GUIDANCE\n\nThis guidance is for the use of video conferencing (VCF) in civil proceedings. It is in part based, with permission, upon the protocol of the Federal Court of Australia. It is intended to provide a guide to all persons involved in the use of VCF, although it does not attempt to cover all the practical questions which might arise. Video conferencing generally\n\n1.The guidance covers the use of VCF equipment both (a) in a courtroom, whether via equipment which is permanently placed there or via a mobile unit, and (b) in a separate studio or conference room. In either case, the location at which the judge sits is referred to as the 'local site'. The other site or sites to and from which transmission is made are referred to as 'the remote site' and in any particular case any such site may be another courtroom. The guidance applies to cases where VCF is used for the taking of evidence and also to its use for other parts of any legal proceedings (for example, interim applications, case management conferences, pre-trial reviews).\n\n2.VCF may be a convenient way of dealing with any part of proceedings: it can involve considerable savings in time and cost. Its use for the taking of evidence from overseas witnesses will, in particular, be likely to achieve a material saving of costs, and such savings may also be achieved by its use for taking domestic evidence. It is, however, inevitably not as ideal as having the witness physically present in court. Its convenience should not therefore be allowed to dictate its use. A judgment must be made in every case in which the use of VCF is being considered not only as to whether it will achieve an overall cost saving but as to whether its use will be likely to be beneficial to the efficient, fair and economic disposal of the litigation. In particular, it needs to be recognised that the degree of control a court can exercise over a witness at the remote site is or may be more limited than it can exercise over a witness physically before it.\n\n3.When used for the taking of evidence, the objective should be to make the VCF session as close as possible to the usual practice in a trial court where evidence is taken in open court. To gain the maximum benefit, several differences have to be taken into account. Some matters, which are taken for granted when evidence is taken in the conventional way, take on a different dimension when it is taken by VCF: for example, the administration of the oath, ensuring that the witness understands who is at the local site and what their various roles are, the raising of any objections to the evidence and the use of documents.\n\n4.It should not be presumed that all foreign governments are willing to allow their nationals or others within their jurisdiction to be examined before a court in England or Wales by means of VCF. If there is any doubt about this, enquiries should be directed to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (Public Facing Services, Taking of Evidence Team)TOE.Enquiries@fcdo.gov.ukwith a view to ensuring that the country from which the evidence is to be taken raises no objection to it at diplomatic level. The party who is directed to be responsible for arranging the VCF (see paragraph 8 below) will be required to make all necessary inquiries about this well in advance of the VCF and must be able to inform the court what those inquiries were and of their outcome.\n\n5.Time zone differences need to be considered when a witness abroad is to be examined in England or Wales by VCF. The convenience of the witness, the parties, their representatives and the court must all be taken into account. The cost of the use of a commercial studio is usually greater outside normal business hours.\n\n6.Those involved with VCF need to be aware that, even with the most advanced systems currently available, there are the briefest of delays between the receipt of the picture and that of the accompanying sound. If due allowance is not made for this, there will be a tendency to 'speak over' the witness, whose voice will continue to be heard for a millisecond or so after he or she appears on the screen to have finished speaking.\n\n7.With current technology, picture quality is good, but not as good as a television picture. The quality of the picture is enhanced if those appearing on VCF monitors keep their movements to a minimum. Preliminary arrangements\n\n8.The court's permission is required for any part of any proceedings to be dealt with by means of VCF. Before seeking a direction, the applicant should notify the listing officer, diary manager or other appropriate court officer of the intention to seek it, and should enquire as to the availability of court VCF equipment for the day or days of the proposed VCF. The application for a direction should be made to the Master, District Judge or Judge, as may be appropriate. If all parties consent to a direction, permission can be sought by letter, fax or e-mail, although the court may still require an oral hearing. All parties are entitled to be heard on whether or not such a direction should be given and as to its terms. If a witness at a remote site is to give evidence by an interpreter, consideration should be given at this stage as to whether the interpreter should be at the local site or the remote site. If a VCF direction is given, arrangements for the transmission will then need to be made. The court will ordinarily direct that the party seeking permission to use VCF is to be responsible for this. That party is hereafter referred to as 'the VCF arranging party'.\n\n9.Subject to any order to the contrary, all costs of the transmission, including the costs of hiring equipment and technical personnel to operate it, will initially be the responsibility of, and must be met by, the VCF arranging party. All reasonable efforts should be made to keep the transmission to a minimum and so keep the costs down. All such costs will be considered to be part of the costs of the proceedings and the court will determine at such subsequent time as is convenient or appropriate who, as between the parties, should be responsible for them and (if appropriate) in what proportions.\n\n10.The local site will, if practicable, be a courtroom but it may instead be an appropriate studio or conference room. The VCF arranging party must contact the listing officer, diary manager or other appropriate officer of the court which made the VCF direction and make arrangements for the VCF transmission. Details of the remote site, and of the equipment to be used both at the local site (if not being supplied by the court) and the remote site (including the number of ISDN lines and connection speed), together with all necessary contact names and telephone numbers, will have to be provided to the listing officer, diary manager or other court officer. The court will need to be satisfied that any equipment provided by the parties for use at the local site and also that at the remote site is of sufficient quality for a satisfactory transmission. The VCF arranging party must ensure that an appropriate person will be present at the local site to supervise the operation of the VCF throughout the transmission in order to deal with any technical problems. That party must also arrange for a technical assistant to be similarly present at the remote site for like purposes.\n\n11.It is recommended that the judge, practitioners and witness should arrive at their respective VCF sites about 20 minutes prior to the scheduled commencement of the transmission.\n\n12.If the local site is not a courtroom, but a conference room or studio, the judge will need to determine who is to sit where. The VCF arranging party must take care to ensure that the number of microphones is adequate for the speakers and that the panning of the camera for the practitioners' table encompasses all legal representatives so that the viewer can see everyone seated there.\n\n13.The proceedings, wherever they may take place, form part of a trial to which the public is entitled to have access (unless the court has determined that they should be heard in private). If the local site is to be a studio or conference room, the VCF arranging party must ensure that it provides sufficient accommodation to enable a reasonable number of members of the public to attend.\n\n14.In cases where the local site is a studio or conference room, the VCF arranging party should make arrangements, if practicable, for the royal coat of arms to be placed above the judge's seat.",

    "content": "Document: Practice Direction 32\nSection: ANNEX 3\nPart 3 of 4\n==================================================\n15.In cases in which the VCF is to be used for the taking of evidence, the VCF arranging party must arrange for recording equipment to be provided by the court which made the VCF direction so that the evidence can be recorded. An associate will normally be present to operate the recording equipment when the local site is a courtroom. The VCF arranging party should take steps to ensure that an associate is present to do likewise when it is a studio or conference room. The equipment should be set up and tested before the VCF transmission. It will often be a valuable safeguard for the VCF arranging party also to arrange for the provision of recording equipment at the remote site. This will provide a useful back-up if there is any reduction in sound quality during the transmission. A direction from the court for the making of such a back-up recording must, however, be obtained first. This is because the proceedings are court proceedings and, save as directed by the court, no other recording of them must be made. The court will direct what is to happen to the back-up recording.\n\n16.Some countries may require that any oath or affirmation to be taken by a witness accord with local custom rather than the usual form of oath or affirmation used in England and Wales. The VCF arranging party must make all appropriate prior inquiries and put in place all arrangements necessary to enable the oath or affirmation to be taken in accordance with any local custom. That party must be in a position to inform the court what those inquiries were, what their outcome was and what arrangements have been made. If the oath or affirmation can be administered in the manner normal in England and Wales, the VCF arranging party must arrange in advance to have the appropriate holy book at the remote site. The associate will normally administer the oath.\n\n17.Consideration will need to be given in advance to the documents to which the witness is likely to be referred. The parties should endeavour to agree on this. It will usually be most convenient for a bundle of the copy documents to be prepared in advance, which the VCF arranging party should then send to the remote site.\n\n18.Additional documents are sometimes quite properly introduced during the course of a witness's evidence. To cater for this, the VCF arranging party should ensure that equipment is available to enable documents to be transmitted between sites during the course of the VCF transmission. Consideration should be given to whether to use a document camera. If it is decided to use one, arrangements for its use will need to be established in advance. The panel operator will need to know the number and size of documents or objects if their images are to be sent by document camera. In many cases, a simpler and sufficient alternative will be to ensure that there are fax transmission and reception facilities at the participating sites. The hearing\n\n19.The procedure for conducting the transmission will be determined by the judge. He will determine who is to control the cameras. In cases where the VCF is being used for an application in the course of the proceedings, the judge will ordinarily not enter the local site until both sites are on line. Similarly, at the conclusion of the hearing, he will ordinarily leave the local site while both sites are still on line. The following paragraphs apply primarily to cases where the VCF is being used for the taking of the evidence of a witness at a remote site. In all cases, the judge will need to decide whether court dress is appropriate when using VCF facilities. It might be appropriate when transmitting from courtroom to courtroom. It might not be when a commercial facility is being used.",

He will probably want to know who is at the remote site and will invite the witness to introduce himself and anyone else who is with him. He may wish to give directions as to the seating arrangements at the remote site so that those present are visible at the local site during the taking of the evidence. He will probably wish to explain to the witness the method of taking the oath or of affirming, the manner in which the evidence will be taken, and who will be conducting the examination and cross-examination. He will probably also wish to inform the witness of the matters referred to in paragraphs 6 and 7 above (co-ordination of picture with sound, and picture quality).\n\n21.The examination of the witness at the remote site should follow as closely as possible the practice adopted when a witness is in the courtroom. During examination, cross-examination and re-examination, the witness must be able to see the legal representative asking the question and also any other person (whether another legal representative or the judge) making any statements in regard to the witness's evidence. It will in practice be most convenient if everyone remains seated throughout the transmission.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 35 - EXPERTS AND ASSESSORS\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Part 35\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nIntroduction\n\n1 Part 35 is intended to limit the use of oral expert evidence to that which is reasonably required. In addition, where possible, matters requiring expert evidence should be dealt with by only one expert. Experts and those instructing them are expected to have regard to the guidance contained in the Guidance for the Instruction of Experts in Civil Claims 2014 atwww.judiciary.gov.uk. (Further guidance on experts is contained in Annex C to the Practice Direction (Pre-Action Conduct)).\n\n---\n\nExpert Evidence - General Requirements\n\n2.1 Expert evidence should be the independent product of the expert uninfluenced by the pressures of litigation.\n\n2.2 Experts should assist the court by providing objective, unbiased opinions on matters within their expertise, and should not assume the role of an advocate.\n\n2.3 Experts should consider all material facts, including those which might detract from their opinions.\n\n2.4 Experts should make it clear -\n\n(a) when a question or issue falls outside their expertise; and\n\n(b) when they are not able to reach a definite opinion, for example because they have insufficient information.\n\n2.5 If, after producing a report, an expert's view changes on any material matter, such change of view should be communicated to all the parties without delay, and when appropriate to the court.\n\n2.6\n\n(1) In a soft tissue injury claim, where permission is given for a fixed cost medical report, the first report must be obtained from an accredited medical expert selected via the Med Co Portal (website at:www.medco.org.uk).\n\n(1 A) In a claim for a whiplash injury, whether or not it is part of a claim for other injuries-\n\n(a) where in respect of the claim for a whiplash injury, permission is given for a fixed cost medical report, the first report must be obtained from an accredited medical expert selected via the Med Co Portal;\n\n(b) where the claimant lives outside England and Wales, but chooses to be examined for the purposes of a medical report in England or Wales, paragraph (a) applies;\n\n(c) where the claimant obtains a medical report in respect of a more serious injury suffered on the same occasion as the whiplash injury, where permission is given, the claimant may use that report instead of a fixed costs medical report under paragraph (a) provided that-\n\n(i) the report is from a doctor who is listed on the General Medical Council's Specialist Register; and\n\n(ii) the report provides evidence of the whiplash injury; and\n\n(d) unless paragraph (b) applies, in any other case where the claimant lives outside England and Wales, the medical report in respect of the claim for the whiplash injury (or, if there is more than one report, the first report) must be from a person who is recognised by the country in which they practise as-\n\n(i) being a medical expert; and\n\n(ii) having the required qualifications for the purposes of diagnosis and prognosis of a whiplash injury.\n\n(2) The cost of obtaining a further report from an expert not listed in rule 35.4(3 C)(a) to (d) or (3 C)(b)(i) to (iv) is not subject to rule 45.62(2)(b), but the use of that expert and the cost must be justified.\n\n(3)\n\nIn this paragraph-\n\n(a) in respect of a soft tissue injury claim, 'accredited medical expert', 'fixed cost medical report', 'Med Co', and 'soft tissue injury claim' have the same meaning as in paragraph 1.1(A 1), (10 A), (12 A) and (16 A), respectively, of the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents; and.\n\n(b) in respect of a claim for a whiplash injury, 'fixed cost medical report', 'accredited medical expert', 'Med Co, and 'whiplash injury' have the same meaning as in paragraph 1.2(1), (17), (19) and (38) of the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents.\n\n---\n\nForm and Content of an Expert's Report\n\n3.1 An expert's report should be addressed to the court and not to the party from whom the expert has received instructions.\n\n3.2 An expert's report must:\n\n(1) give details of the expert's qualifications;\n\n(2) give details of any literature or other material which has been relied on in making the report;\n\n(3) contain a statement setting out the substance of all facts and instructions which are material to the opinions expressed in the report or upon which those opinions are based;\n\n(4) make clear which of the facts stated in the report are within the expert's own knowledge;\n\n(5) say who carried out any examination, measurement, test or experiment which the expert has used for the report, give the qualifications of that person, and say whether or not the test or experiment has been carried out under the expert's supervision;\n\n(6) where there is a range of opinion on the matters dealt with in the report -\n\n(a) summarise the range of opinions; and\n\n(b) give reasons for the expert's own opinion;\n\n(7) contain a summary of the conclusions reached;\n\n(8) if the expert is not able to give an opinion without qualification, state the qualification; and\n\n(9) contain a statement that the expert -\n\n(a) understands their duty to the court, and has complied with that duty; and\n\n(b) is aware of the requirements of Part 35, this practice direction and the Guidance for the Instruction of Experts in Civil Claims 2014.\n\n3.3 An expert's report must be verified by a statement of truth in the following form -\n\nI confirm that I have made clear which facts and matters referred to in this report are within my own knowledge and which are not. Those that are within my own knowledge I confirm to be true. The opinions I have expressed represent my true and complete professional opinions on the matters to which they refer.\n\nI understand that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.\n\nPart 22 deals with statements of truth. Rule 32.14 sets out the consequences of verifying a document containing a false statement without an honest belief in its truth.)\n\n---\n\nInformation\n\n4 Under rule 35.9 the court may direct a party with access to information, which is not reasonably available to another party to serve on that other party a document, which records the information. The document served must include sufficient details of all the facts, tests, experiments and assumptions which underlie any part of the information to enable the party on whom it is served to make, or to obtain, a proper interpretation of the information and an assessment of its significance.\n\n---\n\nInstructions\n\n5 Cross-examination of experts on the contents of their instructions will not be allowed unless the court permits it (or unless the party who gave the instructions consents). Before it gives permission the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the statement in the report of the substance of the instructions is inaccurate or incomplete. If the court is so satisfied, it will allow the cross-examination where it appears to be in the interests of justice.\n\n---\n\nQuestions to Experts\n\n6.1 Where a party sends a written question or questions under rule 35.6 direct to an expert, a copy of the questions must, at the same time, be sent to the other party or parties.\n\n6.2 The party or parties instructing the expert must pay any fees charged by that expert for answering questions put under rule 35.6. This does not affect any decision of the court as to the party who is ultimately to bear the expert's fees.\n\n---\n\nSingle joint expert\n\n7 When considering whether to give permission for the parties to rely on expert evidence and whether that evidence should be from a single joint expert the court will take into account all the circumstances in particular, whether:\n\n(a) it is proportionate to have separate experts for each party on a particular issue with reference to -\n\n(i) the amount in dispute;\n\n(ii) the importance to the parties; and\n\n(iii) the complexity of the issue;\n\n(b) the instruction of a single joint expert is likely to assist the parties and the court to resolve the issue more speedily and in a more cost-effective way than separately instructed experts;\n\n(c) expert evidence is to be given on the issue of liability, causation or quantum;\n\n(d) the expert evidence falls within a substantially established area of knowledge which is unlikely to be in dispute or there is likely to be a range of expert opinion;\n\n(e) a party has already instructed an expert on the issue in question and whether or not that was done in compliance with any practice direction or relevant pre-action protocol;\n\n(f) questions put in accordance with rule 35.6 are likely to remove the need for the other party to instruct an expert if one party has already instructed an expert;\n\n(g) questions put to a single joint expert may not conclusively deal with all issues that may require testing prior to trial;\n\n(h) a conference may be required with the legal representatives, experts and other witnesses which may make instruction of a single joint expert impractical; and\n\n(i) a claim to privilege(GL)makes the instruction of any expert as a single joint expert inappropriate.\n\n---\n\nOrders\n\n8 Where an order requires an act to be done by an expert, or otherwise affects an expert, the party instructing that expert must serve a copy of the order on the expert. The claimant must serve the order on a single joint expert.\n\n---\n\nDiscussions between experts\n\n9.1 Unless directed by the court discussions between experts are not mandatory. Parties must consider, with their experts, at an early stage, whether there is likely to be any useful purpose in holding an experts' discussion and if so when.\n\n9.2 The purpose of discussions between experts is not for experts to settle cases but to agree and narrow issues and in particular to identify:\n\n(i) the extent of the agreement between them;\n\n(ii) the points of and short reasons for any disagreement;\n\n(iii) action, if any, which may be taken to resolve any outstanding points of disagreement; and\n\n(iv) any further material issues not raised and the extent to which these issues are agreed.\n\n9.3 Where the experts are to meet, the parties must discuss and if possible agree whether an agenda is necessary, and if so attempt to agree one that helps the experts to focus on the issues which need to be discussed. The agenda must not be in the form of leading questions or hostile in tone.\n\n9.4 Unless ordered by the court, or agreed by all parties, and the experts, neither the parties nor their legal representatives may attend experts discussions.\n\n9.5 If the legal representatives do attend -\n\n(i) they should not normally intervene in the discussion, except to answer questions put to them by the experts or to advise on the law; and\n\n(ii) the experts may if they so wish hold part of their discussions in the absence of the legal representatives.\n\n9.6 A statement must be prepared by the experts dealing with paragraphs 9.2(i) - (iv) above. Individual copies of the statements must be signed by the experts at the conclusion of the discussion, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and in any event within 7 days. Copies of the statements must be provided to the parties no later than 14 days after signing.\n\n9.7 Experts must give their own opinions to assist the court and do not require the authority of the parties to sign a joint statement.\n\n9.8 If an expert significantly alters an opinion, the joint statement must include a note or addendum by that expert explaining the change of opinion.\n\n---\n\nAssessors\n\n10.1 An assessor may be appointed to assist the court under rule 35.15. Not less than 21 days before making any such appointment, the court will notify each party in writing of the name of the proposed assessor, of the matter in respect of which the assistance of the assessor will be sought and of the qualifications of the assessor to give that assistance.\n\n10.2 Where any person has been proposed for appointment as an assessor, any party may object to that person either personally or in respect of that person's qualification.\n\n10.3 Any such objection must be made in writing and filed with the court within 7 days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 10.1 and will be taken into account by the court in deciding whether or not to make the appointment.\n\n10.4 Copies of any report prepared by the assessor will be sent to each of the parties but the assessor will not give oral evidence or be open to cross-examination or questioning.\n\n---\n\nConcurrent expert evidence\n\n11.1 At any stage in the proceedings the court may direct that some or all of the evidence of experts from like disciplines shall be given concurrently. The procedure set out in paragraph 11.4 shall apply in respect of any part of the evidence which is to be given concurrently.\n\n11.2 To the extent that the expert evidence is not to be given concurrently, the court may direct the evidence to be given in any appropriate manner. This may include a direction for the experts from like disciplines to give their evidence and be cross-examined on an issue-by-issue basis, so that each party calls its expert or experts to give evidence in relation to a particular issue, followed by the other parties calling their expert or experts to give evidence in relation to that issue (and so on for each of the expert issues which are to be addressed in this manner).\n\n11.3 The court may set an agenda for the taking of expert evidence concurrently or on an issue-by-issue basis, or may direct that the parties agree such an agenda subject to the approval of the court. In either case, the agenda should be based upon the areas of disagreement identified in the experts' joint statements made pursuant to rule 35.12.\n\n11.4 Where expert evidence is to be given concurrently, then (after the relevant experts have each taken the oath or affirmed) in relation to each issue on the agenda, and subject to the judge's discretion to modify the procedure-\n\n(1) the judge will initiate the discussion by asking the experts, in turn, for their views in relation to the issues on the agenda. Once an expert has expressed a view the judge may ask questions about it. At one or more appropriate stages when questioning a particular expert, the judge may invite the other expert to comment or to ask that expert's own questions of the first expert;\n\n(2) after the process set out in (1) has been completed for any issue (or all issues), the judge will invite the parties' representatives to ask questions of the experts. Such questioning should be directed towards:\n\n(a) testing the correctness of an expert's view;\n\n(b) seeking clarification of an expert's view; or\n\n(c) eliciting evidence on any issue (or on any aspect of an issue) which has been omitted from consideration during the process set out in (1); and\n\n(3) after the process set out in (2) has been completed in relation to any issue (or all issues), the judge may summarise the experts' different positions on the issue and ask them to confirm or correct that summary.",

    "content": "Document: Part 36 – Offers to Settle\nPart 1 of 2\n==================================================\nPART 36 - OFFERS TO SETTLE\n\nContents of this Part Scope of this Part\n\n36.1\n\n(1) This Part contains a self-contained procedural code about offers to settle made pursuant to the procedure set out in this Part (\"Part 36 offers\").\n\n(2) Section I of this Part contains general rules about Part 36 offers.\n\n(3) Section II of this Part contains rules about Part 36 offers where a claim is one to which Section VI (fixed costs in the fast track), Section VII (fixed costs in the intermediate track) or Section VIII (claims for noise-induced hearing loss) of Part 45 applies.\n\n(4) Section III of this Part contains rules about offers to settle where the parties have followed the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents (\"the RTA Protocol\") or the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury (Employers' Liability and Public Liability) Claims (\"the EL/PL Protocol\") and have started proceedings under Part 8 in accordance with Practice Direction 49 F. I PART 36 OFFERS TO SETTLE\n\nGeneral Scope of this Section\n\n36.2\n\n(1) This Section-\n\n(a)applies to an offer to settle to which Section II of this Part applies, unless otherwise stated; but\n\n(b)does not apply to an offer to settle to which Section III applies.\n\n(2) Nothing in this Section prevents a party making an offer to settle in whatever way that party chooses, but if the offer is not made in accordance with rule 36.5, it will not have the consequences specified in this Section.\n\n(Rule 44.2 requires the court to consider an offer to settle that does not have the costs consequences set out in this Section in deciding what order to make about costs.)\n\n(3) A Part 36 offer may be made in respect of the whole, or part of, or any issue that arises in-\n\n(a) a claim, counterclaim or other additional claim; or\n\n(b) an appeal or cross-appeal from a decision made at a trial.\n\n(Rules 20.2 and 20.3 provide that counterclaims and other additional claims are treated as claims and that references to a claimant or a defendant include a party bringing or defending an additional claim.) Definitions\n\n36.3 In this Section-\n\n(a) the party who makes an offer is the \"offeror\";\n\n(b) the party to whom an offer is made is the \"offeree\";\n\n(c) a \"trial\" means any trial in a case whether it is a trial of all issues or a trial of liability, quantum or some other issue in the case;\n\n(d) a trial is \"in progress\" from the time when it starts until the time when judgment is given or handed down;\n\n(e) a case is \"decided\" when all issues in the case have been determined, whether at one or more trials;\n\n(f) \"trial judge\" includes the judge (if any) allocated in advance to conduct a trial; and\n\n(g) \"the relevant period\" means-\n\n(i) in the case of an offer made not less than 21 days before a trial, the period specified under rule 36.5(1)(c) or such longer period as the parties agree;\n\n(ii) otherwise, the period up to the end of such trial. Application of Part 36 to appeals\n\n36.4\n\n(1) Except where a Part 36 offer is made in appeal proceedings, it shall have the consequences set out in this Section only in relation to the costs of the proceedings in respect of which it is made, and not in relation to the costs of any appeal from a decision in those proceedings.\n\n(2) Where a Part 36 offer is made in appeal proceedings, references in this Section to a term in the first column below shall be treated, unless the context requires otherwise, as references to the corresponding term in the second column- Making offers Form and content of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.5\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer must-\n\n(a) be in writing;\n\n(b) make clear that it is made pursuant to Part 36;\n\n(c) specify a period of not less than 21 days within which the defendant will be liable for the claimant's costs in accordance with rule 36.13 or 36.23 if the offer is accepted;\n\n(d) state whether it relates to the whole of the claim or to part of it or to an issue that arises in it and if so to which part or issue; and\n\n(e) state whether it takes into account any counterclaim.\n\n(Rule 36.7 makes provision for when a Part 36 offer is made.)\n\n(2) Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply if the offer is made less than 21 days before the start of a trial.\n\n(3) In appropriate cases, a Part 36 offer must contain such further information as is required by rule 36.18 (personal injury claims for future pecuniary loss), rule 36.19 (offer to settle a claim for provisional damages), and rule 36.20 (deduction of benefits).\n\n(4) A Part 36 offer which offers to pay or offers to accept a sum of money will be treated as inclusive of all interest until-\n\n(a) the date on which the period specified under rule 36.5(1)(c) expires; or\n\n(b) if rule 36.5(2) applies, a date 21 days after the date the offer was made.\n\n(5) A Part 36 offer to accept a sum of money may make provision for accrual of interest on such sum after the date specified in paragraph (4). If such an offer does not make any such provision, it shall be treated as inclusive of all interest up to the date of acceptance if it is later accepted. Part 36 offers - defendant's offer\n\n36.6\n\n(1) Subject to rules 36.18(3) and 36.19(1), a Part 36 offer by a defendant to pay a sum of money in settlement of a claim must be an offer to pay a single sum of money.\n\n(2) A defendant's offer that includes an offer to pay all or part of the sum at a date later than 14 days following the date of acceptance will not be treated as a Part 36 offer unless the offeree accepts the offer. Time when a Part 36 offer is made\n\n36.7\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer may be made at any time, including before the commencement of proceedings.\n\n(2) A Part 36 offer is made when it is served on the offeree.\n\n(Part 6 provides detailed rules about service of documents.)\n\nClarifying, withdrawing and changing the terms of offers Clarification of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.8\n\n(1) The offeree may, within 7 days of a Part 36 offer being made, request the offeror to clarify the offer.\n\n(2) If the offeror does not give the clarification requested under paragraph (1) within 7 days of receiving the request, the offeree may, unless the trial has started, apply for an order that the offeror do so.\n\n(Part 23 contains provisions about making an application to the court.)\n\n(3) If the court makes an order under paragraph (2), it must specify the date when the Part 36 offer is to be treated as having been made. Withdrawing or changing the terms of a Part 36 offer generally\n\n36.9\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer can only be withdrawn, or its terms changed, if the offeree has not previously served notice of acceptance.\n\n(2) The offeror withdraws the offer or changes its terms by serving written notice of the withdrawal or change of terms on the offeree.\n\n(Rule 36.17(7) deals with the costs consequences following judgment of an offer which is withdrawn.)\n\n(3) Subject to rule 36.10, such notice of withdrawal or change of terms takes effect when it is served on the offeree.\n\n(Rule 36.10 makes provision about when permission is required to withdraw or change the terms of an offer before the expiry of the relevant period.)\n\n(4) Subject to paragraph (1), after expiry of the relevant period-\n\n(a) the offeror may withdraw the offer or change its terms without the permission of the court; or\n\n(b) the offer may be automatically withdrawn in accordance with its terms.\n\n(5) Where the offeror changes the terms of a Part 36 offer to make it more advantageous to the offeree-\n\n(a) such improved offer shall be treated, not as the withdrawal of the original offer; but as the making of a new Part 36 offer on the improved terms; and\n\n(b) subject to rule 36.5(2), the period specified under rule 36.5(1)(c) shall be 21 days or such longer period (if any) identified in the written notice referred to in paragraph (2). Withdrawing or changing the terms of a Part 36 offer before the expiry of the relevant period\n\n36.10\n\n(1) Subject to rule 36.9(1), this rule applies where the offeror serves notice before expiry of the relevant period of withdrawal of the offer or change of its terms to be less advantageous to the offeree.\n\n(2) Where this rule applies-\n\n(a) if the offeree has not served notice of acceptance of the original offer by the expiry of the relevant period, the offeror's notice has effect on the expiry of that period; and\n\n(b) if the offeree serves notice of acceptance of the original offer before the expiry of the relevant period, that acceptance has effect unless the offeror applies to the court for permission to withdraw the offer or to change its terms-\n\n(i) within 7 days of the offeree's notice of acceptance; or\n\n(ii) if earlier, before the first day of trial.\n\n(3) On an application under paragraph (2)(b), the court may give permission for the original offer to be withdrawn or its terms changed if satisfied that there has been a change of circumstances since the making of the original offer and that it is in the interests of justice to give permission. Accepting offers Acceptance of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.11\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer is accepted by serving written notice of acceptance on the offeror.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4) and to rule 36.12, a Part 36 offer may be accepted at any time (whether or not the offeree has subsequently made a different offer), unless it has already been withdrawn.\n\n(Rule 21.10 deals with compromise, etc. by or on behalf of a child or protected party.)\n\n(Rules 36.9 and 36.10 deal with withdrawal of Part 36 offers.)\n\n(3) The court's permission is required to accept a Part 36 offer where-\n\n(a) rule 36.15(4) applies;\n\n(b) rule 36.20(3)(b) applies, the relevant period has expired and further deductible amounts have been paid to the claimant since the date of the offer;\n\n(c) an apportionment is required under rule 41.3 A; or\n\n(d) a trial is in progress.\n\n(Rule 36.15 deals with offers by some but not all of multiple defendants.)\n\n(Rule 36.20 defines \"deductible amounts\".)\n\n(Rule 41.3 A requires an apportionment in proceedings under the Fatal Accidents Act 19761 and Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 19342.)\n\n(4) Where the court gives permission under paragraph (3), unless all the parties have agreed costs, the court must make an order dealing with costs, and may order that the costs consequences set out in rule 36.13 apply. Acceptance of a Part 36 offer in a split-trial case\n\n36.12\n\n(1) This rule applies in any case where there has been a trial but the case has not been decided within the meaning of rule 36.3.\n\n(2) Any Part 36 offer which relates only to parts of the claim or issues that have already been decided can no longer be accepted.\n\n(3) Subject to paragraph (2) and unless the parties agree, any other Part 36 offer cannot be accepted earlier than 7 clear days after judgment is given or handed down in such trial. Costs consequences of acceptance of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.13\n\n(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (4) and to rule 36.23, where a Part 36 offer is accepted within the relevant period the claimant will be entitled to the costs of the proceedings (including their recoverable pre-action costs) up to the date on which notice of acceptance was served on the offeror.\n\n(Rule 36.20 makes provision for the costs consequences of accepting a Part 36 offer in certain personal injury claims where the claim no longer proceeds under the RTA or EL/PL Protocol.)\n\n(2) Where-\n\n(a) a defendant's Part 36 offer relates to part only of the claim; and\n\n(b) at the time of serving notice of acceptance within the relevant period the claimant abandons the balance of the claim,\n\nthe claimant will only be entitled to the costs of such part of the claim unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(3) Except where the recoverable costs are fixed by these Rules, costs under paragraphs (1) and (2) are to be assessed on the standard basis if the amount of costs is not agreed.\n\n(Rule 44.3(2) explains the standard basis for the assessment of costs.)\n\n(Rule 44.9 contains provisions about when a costs order is deemed to have been made and applying for an order under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 20073.)\n\n(Part 45 provides for fixed costs in certain classes of case.)\n\n(4) Where-\n\n(a) a Part 36 offer which was made less than 21 days before the start of a trial is accepted; or\n\n(b) a Part 36 offer which relates to the whole of the claim is accepted after expiry of the relevant period; or\n\n(c) subject to paragraph (2), a Part 36 offer which does not relate to the whole of the claim is accepted at any time,\n\nthe liability for costs must be determined by the court unless the parties have agreed the costs.\n\n(5) Where paragraph (4)(b) applies but the parties cannot agree the liability for costs, the court must, unless it considers it unjust to do so, order that-\n\n(a) the claimant be awarded costs up to the date on which the relevant period expired; and\n\n(b) the offeree do pay the offeror's costs for the period from the date of expiry of the relevant period to the date of acceptance.\n\n(6) In considering whether it would be unjust to make the orders specified in paragraph (5), the court must take into account all the circumstances of the case including the matters listed in rule 36.17(5).\n\n(7) The claimant's costs include any costs incurred in dealing with the defendant's counterclaim if the Part 36 offer states that it takes it into account. Other effects of acceptance of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.14\n\n(1) If a Part 36 offer is accepted, the claim will be stayed.\n\n(2) In the case of acceptance of a Part 36 offer which relates to the whole claim, the stay will be upon the terms of the offer.\n\n(3) If a Part 36 offer which relates to part only of the claim is accepted, the claim will be stayed as to that part upon the terms of the offer.\n\n(4) If the approval of the court is required before a settlement can be binding, any stay which would otherwise arise on the acceptance of a Part 36 offer will take effect only when that approval has been given.\n\n(5) Any stay arising under this rule will not affect the power of the court-\n\n(a) to enforce the terms of a Part 36 offer; or\n\n(b) to deal with any question of costs (including interest on costs) relating to the proceedings.\n\n(6) Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, where a Part 36 offer that is or includes an offer to pay or accept a single sum of money is accepted, that sum must be paid to the claimant within 14 days of the date of-\n\n(a) acceptance; or\n\n(b) the order when the court makes an order under rule 41.2 (order for an award of provisional damages) or rule 41.8 (order for an award of periodical payments), unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(7) If such sum is not paid within 14 days of acceptance of the offer, or such other period as has been agreed, the claimant may enter judgment for the unpaid sum.\n\n(8) Where-\n\n(a) a Part 36 offer (or part of a Part 36 offer) which is not an offer to which paragraph (6) applies is accepted; and\n\n(b) a party alleges that the other party has not honoured the terms of the offer,\n\nthat party may apply to enforce the terms of the offer without the need for a new claim. Acceptance of a Part 36 offer made by one or more, but not all, defendants\n\n36.15\n\n(1) This rule applies where the claimant wishes to accept a Part 36 offer made by one or more, but not all, of a number of defendants.\n\n(2) If the defendants are sued jointly or in the alternative, the claimant may accept the offer if-\n\n(a) the claimant discontinues the claim against those defendants who have not made the offer; and\n\n(b) those defendants give written consent to the acceptance of the offer.\n\n(3) If the claimant alleges that the defendants have a several liability(GL)to the claimant, the claimant may-\n\n(a) accept the offer; and\n\n(b) continue with the claims against the other defendants if entitled to do so.\n\n(4) In all other cases the claimant must apply to the court for permission to accept the Part 36 offer. Unaccepted offers Restriction on disclosure of a Part 36 offer\n\n36.16\n\n(1) A Part 36 offer will be treated as \"without prejudice except as to costs\".\n\n(2) The fact that a Part 36 offer has been made and the terms of such offer must not be communicated to the trial judge until the case has been decided.\n\n(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply-\n\n(a) where the defence of tender before claim has been raised;\n\n(b) where the proceedings have been stayed under rule 36.14 following acceptance of a Part 36 offer;\n\n(c) where the offeror and the offeree agree in writing that it should not apply; or\n\n(d) where, although the case has not been decided-\n\n(i) any part of, or issue in, the case has been decided; and\n\n(ii) the Part 36 offer relates only to parts or issues that have been decided.\n\n(4) In a case to which paragraph (3)(d)(i) applies, the trial judge-\n\n(a) may be told whether or not there are Part 36 offers other than those referred to in paragraph (3)(d)(ii); but\n\n(b) must not be told the terms of any such other offers unless any of paragraphs (3)(a) to (c) applies. Costs consequences following judgment\n\n36.17\n\n(1) Subject to rule 36.24, this rule applies where upon judgment being entered-\n\n(a) a claimant fails to obtain a judgment more advantageous than a defendant's Part 36 offer; or\n\n(b) judgment against the defendant is at least as advantageous to the claimant as the proposals contained in a claimant's Part 36 offer.\n\n(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), in relation to any money claim or money element of a claim, \"more advantageous\" means better in money terms by any amount, however small, and \"at least as advantageous\" shall be construed accordingly.\n\n(3) Subject to paragraphs (7) and (8), where paragraph (1)(a) applies, the court must, unless it considers it unjust to do so, order that the defendant is entitled to-\n\n(a) costs (including any recoverable pre-action costs) from the date on which the relevant period expired; and\n\n(b) interest on those costs.\n\n(4) Subject to paragraph (7), where paragraph (1)(b) applies, the court must, unless it considers it unjust to do so, order that the claimant is entitled to-\n\n(a) interest on the whole or part of any sum of money (excluding interest) awarded, at a rate not exceeding 10% above base rate for some or all of the period starting with the date on which the relevant period expired;\n\n(b) costs (including any recoverable pre-action costs) on the indemnity basis from the date on which the relevant period expired;\n\n(c) interest on those costs at a rate not exceeding 10% above base rate; and\n\n(d) provided that the case has been decided and there has not been a previous order under this sub-paragraph, an additional amount, which shall not exceed £75,000, calculated by applying the prescribed percentage set out below to an amount which is-\n\n(i) the sum awarded to the claimant by the court; or\n\n(ii) where there is no monetary award, the sum awarded to the claimant by the court in respect of costs-\n\n(5) In considering whether it would be unjust to make the orders referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4), the court must take into account all the circumstances of the case including-\n\n(a) the terms of any Part 36 offer;\n\n(b) the stage in the proceedings when any Part 36 offer was made, including in particular how long before the trial started the offer was made;\n\n(c) the information available to the parties at the time when the Part 36 offer was made;\n\n(d) the conduct of the parties with regard to the giving of or refusal to give information for the purposes of enabling the offer to be made or evaluated; and\n\n(e) whether the offer was a genuine attempt to settle the proceedings.\n\n(6) Where the court awards interest under this rule and also awards interest on the same sum and for the same period under any other power, the total rate of interest must not exceed 10% above base rate.\n\n(7) Paragraphs (3) and (4) do not apply to a Part 36 offer-\n\n(a) which has been withdrawn;\n\n(b) which has been changed so that its terms are less advantageous to the offeree where the offeree has beaten the less advantageous offer;\n\n(c) made less than 21 days before trial, unless the court has abridged the relevant period.\n\n(8) Paragraph (3) does not apply to a soft tissue injury claim to which rule 36.21 applies.\n\n(Rule 44.2 requires the court to consider an offer to settle that does not have the costs consequences set out in this Section in deciding what order to make about costs.) Personal injury claims Personal injury claims for future pecuniary loss\n\n36.18\n\n(1) This rule applies to a claim for damages for personal injury which is or includes a claim for future pecuniary loss.\n\n(2) An offer to settle such a claim will not have the consequences set out in this Section unless it is made by way of a Part 36 offer under this rule.\n\n(3) A Part 36 offer to which this rule applies may contain an offer to pay, or an offer to accept-\n\n(a) the whole or part of the damages for future pecuniary loss in the form of-\n\n(i) a lump sum;\n\n(ii) periodical payments; or\n\n(iii) both a lump sum and periodical payments;\n\n(b) the whole or part of any other damages in the form of a lump sum.\n\n(4) A Part 36 offer to which this rule applies-\n\n(a) must state the amount of any offer to pay or to accept the whole or part of any damages in the form of a lump sum;\n\n(b) may state-\n\n(i) what part of the lump sum, if any, relates to damages for future pecuniary loss; and\n\n(ii) what part relates to other damages to be paid or accepted in the form of a lump sum;\n\n(c) must state what part of the offer relates to damages for future pecuniary loss to be paid or accepted in the form of periodical payments and must specify-\n\n(i) the amount and duration of the periodical payments;\n\n(ii) the amount of any payments for substantial capital purchases and when they are to be made; and\n\n(iii) that each amount is to vary by reference to the retail prices index (or to some other named index, or that it is not to vary by reference to any index); and\n\n(d) must state either that any damages which take the form of periodical payments will be funded in a way which ensures that the continuity of payments is reasonably secure in accordance with section 2(4) of the Damages Act 19964 or how such damages are to be paid and how the continuity of their payment is to be secured.\n\n(5) Rule 36.6 applies to the extent that a Part 36 offer by a defendant under this rule includes an offer to pay all or part of any damages in the form of a lump sum.",

Offer to settle a claim for provisional damages\n\n36.19\n\n(1) An offeror may make a Part 36 offer in respect of a claim which includes a claim for provisional damages.\n\n(2) Where the offeror does so, the Part 36 offer must specify whether or not the offeror is proposing that the settlement shall include an award of provisional damages.\n\n(3) Where the offeror is offering to agree to the making of an award of provisional damages, the Part 36 offer must also state-\n\n(a) that the sum offered is in satisfaction of the claim for damages on the assumption that the injured person will not develop the disease or suffer the type of deterioration specified in the offer;\n\n(b) that the offer is subject to the condition that the claimant must make any claim for further damages within a limited period; and\n\n(c) what that period is.\n\n(4) Rule 36.6 applies to the extent that a Part 36 offer by a defendant includes an offer to agree to the making of an award of provisional damages.\n\n(5) If the offeree accepts the Part 36 offer, the claimant must, within 7 days of the date of acceptance, apply to the court for an award of provisional damages under rule 41.2. Deduction of benefits and lump sum payments\n\n36.20\n\n(1) In this rule and rule 36.11-\n\n(a) \"the 1997 Act\" means the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 19975;\n\n(b) \"the 2008 Regulations\" means the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits)(Lump Sum Payments) Regulations 20086;\n\n(c) \"recoverable amount\" means-\n\n(i) \"recoverable benefits\" as defined in section 1(4)(c) of the 1997 Act; and\n\n(ii) \"recoverable lump sum payments\" as defined in regulation 1 of the 2008 Regulations;\n\n(d) \"deductible amount\" means-\n\n(i) any benefits by the amount of which damages are to be reduced in accordance with section 8 of, and Schedule 2 to the 1997 Act 7(\"deductible benefits\"); and\n\n(ii) any lump sum payment by the amount of which damages are to be reduced in accordance with regulation 12 of the 2008 Regulations (\"deductible lump sum payments\"); and\n\n(e) \"certificate\"-\n\n(i) in relation to recoverable benefits, is construed in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act; and\n\n(ii) in relation to recoverable lump sum payments, has the meaning given in section 29 of the 1997 Act, as applied by regulation 2 of, and modified by Schedule 1 to, the 2008 Regulations.\n\n(2) This rule applies where a payment to a claimant following acceptance of a Part 36 offer would be a compensation payment as defined in section 1(4)(b) or 1 A(5)(b)8 of the 1997 Act.\n\n(3) A defendant who makes a Part 36 offer must, where relevant, state either-\n\n(a) that the offer is made without regard to any liability for recoverable amounts; or\n\n(b) that it is intended to include any deductible amounts.\n\n(4) Where paragraph (3)(b) applies, paragraphs (5) to (9) will apply to the Part 36 offer.\n\n(5) Before making the Part 36 offer, the offeror must apply for a certificate.\n\n(6) Subject to paragraph (7), the Part 36 offer must state-\n\n(a) the gross amount of compensation;\n\n(b) the name and amount of any deductible amounts by which the gross amount is reduced; and\n\n(c) the net amount of compensation.\n\n(7) If at the time the offeror makes the Part 36 offer, the offeror has applied for, but has not received, a certificate, the offeror must clarify the offer by stating the matters referred to in paragraph (6)(b) and (c) not more than 7 days after receipt of the certificate.\n\n(8) For the purposes of rule 36.17(1)(a), a claimant fails to recover more than any sum offered (including a lump sum offered under rule 36.6) if the claimant fails upon judgment being entered to recover a sum, once deductible amounts identified in the judgment have been deducted, greater than the net amount stated under paragraph (6)(c).\n\n(Section 15(2) of the 1997 Act provides that the court must specify the compensation payment attributable to each head of damage. Schedule 1 to the 2008 Regulations modifies section 15 of the 1997 Act in relation to lump sum payments and provides that the court must specify the compensation payment attributable to each or any dependant who has received a lump sum payment.)\n\n(9) Where-\n\n(a) further deductible amounts have accrued since the Part 36 offer was made; and\n\n(b) the court gives permission to accept the Part 36 offer,\n\nthe court may direct that the amount of the offer payable to the offeree shall be reduced by a sum equivalent to the deductible amounts paid to the claimant since the date of the offer.\n\n(Rule 36.11(3)(b) states that permission is required to accept an offer where the relevant period has expired and further deductible amounts have been paid to the claimant.) Miscellaneous Cases in which the offeror's costs have been limited to court fees\n\n36.21\n\n(1) This rule applies in any case where the offeror is treated as having filed a costs budget limited to applicable court fees, or is otherwise limited in their recovery of costs to such fees.\n\n(Rule 3.14 provides that a litigant may be treated as having filed a budget limited to court fees for failure to file a budget.)\n\n(2) \"Costs\" in rules 36.13(5)(b), 36.17(3)(a) and 36.17(4)(b) shall mean-\n\n(a) in respect of those costs subject to any such limitation, 50% of the costs assessed without reference to the limitation; together with\n\n(b) any other recoverable costs. SECTION II Claims to Which Sections VI, VII, or VIII of Part 45 Apply Scope of this Section and definitions\n\n36.22.-(1) This Section applies where a claim is one to which Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of Part 45 applies.\n\n(2) In this Section-\n\n(a)\"fixed cost medical report\" and \"soft tissue injury claim\" have the meaning ascribed by paragraph 1.1(10 A) and (16 A) respectively of the RTA Protocol;\n\n(b)for the purposes of rules 36.23 and 36.24, a defendant's Protocol offer is either-\n\n(i)defined in accordance with rules 36.26 and 36.27; or\n\n(ii)if the claim leaves the Protocol before the Court Proceedings Pack Form is sent to the defendant-\n\n(aa)the last offer made by the defendant before the claim leaves the Protocol; and\n\n(bb)deemed to be made on the first business day after the claim leaves the Protocol; and\n\n(c)reference to-\n\n(i)the \"Court Proceedings Pack Form\" is a reference to the form used in the Protocol; and\n\n(ii)\"business day\" is a reference to a business day as defined in rule 6.2.

Form and content of a Protocol offer\n\n36.26\n\n(1) An offer to settle which is made in accordance with this rule is called a Protocol offer.\n\n(2) A Protocol offer must-\n\n(a) be set out in the Court Proceedings Pack (Part B) Form; and\n\n(b) contain the final total amount of the offers from both parties. Time when a Protocol offer is made\n\n36.27\n\n(1) The Protocol offer is deemed to be made on the first business day after the Court Proceedings Pack (Part A and Part B) Form is sent to the defendant.\n\n(2) In this Section \"business day\" has the same meaning as in rule 6.2.

    "content": "PART 38 - DISCONTINUANCE\n\n---\n\nContents of this Part\n\n---\n\nScope of this Part\n\n38.1\n\n(1) The rules in this Part set out the procedure by which a claimant may discontinue all or part of a claim. A \"claim\" includes a cause of action or part of one.\n\n(2) A claimant who -\n\n(a) claims more than one remedy; and\n\n(b) subsequently abandons their claim to one or more of the remedies but continues with their claim for the other remedies,\n\nis not treated as discontinuing all or part of a claim for the purposes of this Part.\n\n(The procedure for amending a statement of case, set out in Part 17, applies where a claimant abandons a claim for a particular remedy but wishes to continue with his claim for other remedies)\n\n---\n\nRight to discontinue claim\n\n38.2\n\n(1) At any time, a claimant may discontinue all or part of a claim against one or more defendants.\n\n(2) However -\n\n(a) a claimant must obtain the permission of the court if they wish to discontinue all or part of a claim in relation to which -\n\n(i) the court has granted an interim injunction(GL); or\n\n(ii) any party has given an undertaking to the court;\n\n(b) where the claimant has received an interim payment in relation to a claim (whether voluntarily or pursuant to an order under Part 25), he may discontinue that claim only if -\n\n(i) the defendant who made the interim payment consents in writing; or\n\n(ii) the court gives permission;\n\n(c) where there is more than one claimant, a claimant may not discontinue unless -\n\n(i) every other claimant consents in writing; or\n\n(ii) the court gives permission.\n\n---\n\nProcedure for discontinuing\n\n38.3\n\n(1) To discontinue a claim or part of a claim, a claimant must -\n\n(a) file a notice of discontinuance; and\n\n(b) serve a copy of it on every other party to the proceedings.\n\n(2) The claimant must state in the notice of discontinuance that they have served notice of discontinuance on every other party to the proceedings.\n\n(3) Where the claimant needs the consent of some other party, a copy of the necessary consent must be attached to the notice of discontinuance.\n\n(4) Where there is more than one defendant, the notice of discontinuance must specify against which defendants the claim is discontinued.\n\n(5) A notice of discontinuance must be in Form N 279 unless the court permits otherwise.\n\n---\n\nRight to apply to have notice of discontinuance set aside\n\n38.4\n\n(1) Where the claimant discontinues under rule 38.2(1) the defendant may apply to have the notice of discontinuance set aside(GL).\n\n(2) The defendant may not make an application under this rule more than 28 days after the date when the notice of discontinuance was served on them.\n\n---\n\nWhen discontinuance takes effect where permission of the court is not needed\n\n38.5\n\n(1) Discontinuance against any defendant takes effect on the date when notice of discontinuance is served on them under rule 38.3(1).\n\n(2) Subject to rule 38.4, claim is brought to an end as against that defendant on that date.\n\n(3) However, this does not affect proceedings to deal with any question of costs.\n\n---\n\nLiability for costs\n\n38.6\n\n(1) Unless the court orders otherwise, a claimant who discontinues is liable for the costs which a defendant against whom the claimant discontinues incurred on or before the date on which notice of discontinuance was served on the defendant.\n\n(2) If proceedings are only partly discontinued -\n\n(a) the claimant is liable under paragraph (1) for costs relating only to the discontinued part of the proceedings; and\n\n(b) unless the court orders otherwise, the costs which the claimant is liable to pay must not be assessed until the conclusion of the rest of the proceedings.\n\n(3) This rule does not apply to claims allocated to the small claims track.\n\n(Rule 44.9 provides for the basis of assessment where the right to costs arises on discontinuance and contains provisions about when a costs order is deemed to have been made and applying for an order under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 2007)\n\n---\n\nDiscontinuance and subsequent proceedings\n\n38.7\n\n(1) A claimant who discontinues a claim needs the permission of the court to make another claim against the same defendant if-\n\n(a )they discontinued the claim after the defendant filed a defence or, in a Part 8 claim, filed an acknowledgment of service or written evidence; and\n\n(b) the other claim arises out of facts which are the same or substantially the same as those relating to the discontinued claim.\n\n(2) If the claimant considers that permission is needed, the application for permission shall be included in the claim form and claim will proceed only if permission is granted.\n\n(3) The defendant shall inform the court in writing as soon as practicable whether the defendant asserts that permission is needed and, if so, whether the defendant consents to permission being granted.\n\n(4) If the parties agree that permission should be granted, the court shall issue an order granting permission on the papers or make such other order as it thinks fit.\n\n(5) If the parties disagree about whether permission should be granted, the court shall determine the issue either at a hearing or, in its discretion, on the papers after receiving written representations.\n\n(6) The defendant is not required to file an acknowledgment of service unless and until permission is granted.\n\n---\n\nStay of remainder of partly discontinued proceedings where costs not paid\n\n38.8\n\n(1) This rule applies where -\n\n(a) proceedings are partly discontinued;\n\n(b) a claimant is liable to -\n\n(i) pay costs under rule 38.6; or\n\n(ii) make a payment pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 2007; and\n\n(c) the claimant fails to pay those costs or make the payment within 14 days of -\n\n(i) the date on which the parties agreed the sum payable by the claimant; or\n\n(ii) the date on which the court ordered the costs to be paid or the payment to be made.\n\n(2) Where this rule applies, the court may stay(GL)the remainder of the proceedings until the claimant pays the whole of the costs which the claimant is liable to pay under rule 38.6 or makes the payment pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 2007.\n\n(Rules 44.9 and 46.7 contain provisions about applying for an order under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 2007.)",

(To do so without permission constitutes a contempt of court under section 9 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981(1).)\n\n(3) Any party or person may require a transcript or transcripts of the recording of any hearing to be supplied to them, upon payment of the charges authorised by any scheme in force for the making of the recording or the transcript.\n\n(Paragraph 6(2) of Practice Direction 52 C (Appeals to the Court of Appeal) deals with the provision of transcripts for use in the Court of Appeal at public expense.)\n\n(4) Where the person requiring the transcript or transcripts is not a party to the proceedings and the hearing or any part of it was held in private under rule 39(2), paragraph (3) of this rule does not apply unless the court so orders.\n\n(5) At any hearing, whether in public or in private, the judge may give appropriate directions to assist a party, in particular one who is or has been or may become unrepresented, for the compilation and sharing of any note or other informal record of the proceedings made by another party or by the court.\n\n---\n\nDiscontinuance and settlement\n\n39.10\n\n(1) Where a claim is discontinued or settled after a date for the trial or trial window (the period during which it is expected that the trial will take place) has been fixed, the parties must ensure that the listing officer for the trial court is notified immediately.\n\n(2) If an order is drawn up giving effect to the discontinuance or settlement, a copy of the order should be filed with the listing officer.\".",

The court officer may do so in those cases provided that:\n\n(1) none of the parties is a litigant in person, and\n\n(2) the approval of the court is not required by the Rules, a practice direction or any enactment 4.\n\n3.2 If a consent order filed for sealing appears to be unclear or incorrect the court officer may refer it to a judge for consideration 5.\n\n3.3 Where a consent judgment or order does not come within the provisions of rule 40.6(2):\n\n(1) an application notice requesting a judgment or order in the agreed terms should be filed with the draft judgment or order to be entered or sealed, and\n\n(2) the draft judgment or order must be drawn so that the judge's name and judicial title can be inserted.\n\n3.4 A consent judgment or order must:\n\n(1) be drawn up in the terms agreed,\n\n(2) bear on it the words 'By Consent', and\n\n(3) be signed by\n\n(a) solicitors or counsel acting for each of the parties to the order, or\n\n(b) where a party is a litigant in person, the litigant 6.\n\n3.5 Where the parties draw up a consent order in the form of a stay of proceedings on agreed terms, disposing of the proceedings 7,and where the terms are recorded in a schedule to the order, any direction for:\n\n(1) payment of money out of court, or\n\n(2) payment and assessment of costs\n\nshould be contained in the body of the order and not in the schedule.\n\n---\n\nCorrection of errors in judgments and orders\n\n4.1 Where a judgment or order contains an accidental slip or omission a party may apply for it to be corrected 8.\n\n4.2 The application notice (which may be an informal document such as a letter) should describe the error and set out the correction required. An application may be dealt with without a hearing:\n\n(1) where the applicant so requests,\n\n(2) with the consent of the parties, or\n\n(3) where the court does not consider that a hearing would be appropriate.\n\n4.3 The judge may deal with the application without notice if the slip or omission is obvious or may direct notice of the application to be given to the other party or parties.\n\n4.4 If the application is opposed it should, if practicable, be listed for hearing before the judge who gave the judgment or made the order.\n\n4.5 The court has an inherent power to vary its own orders to make the meaning and intention of the court clear.\n\n---\n\nAdjustment of final judgment figure in respect of Compensation Recovery Payments\n\n5.1 In a final judgment where some or all of the damages awarded -\n\n(1) fall under the heads of damage set out in column 1 of Schedule 2 to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 ('the 1997 Act') in respect of recoverable benefits received by the claimant set out in column 2 of that Schedule; and\n\n(2) where the defendant has paid to the Secretary of State the recoverable benefits in accordance with the certificate (as defined in rule 36.20(1)(e)),\n\nthere will be stated in the preamble to the judgment or order the amount awarded under each head of damage and the amount by which it has been reduced in accordance with section 8 of and Schedule 2 to the 1997 Act.\n\n5.1 AWhere damages are awarded in a case where a lump sum payment (to be construed in accordance with section 1 A of the 1997 Act) has been made to a dependant, then section 15 of the 1997 Act (as modified by Schedule 1 to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits)(Lump Sum Payments) Regulations 2008 sets out what the court order must contain.\n\n5.2 The judgment or order should then provide for entry of judgment and payment of the balance.\n\n---\n\nAdjustment of final judgment figure in respect of an interim payment\n\n6.1 In a final judgment 9 where an interim payment has previously been made which is less than the total amount awarded by the judge, the judgment or order should set out in a preamble:\n\n(1) the total amount awarded by the judge, and\n\n(2) the amount and date of the interim payment(s).\n\n6.2 The total amount awarded by the judge should then be reduced by the total amount of any interim payments, and the judgment or order should then provide for entry of judgment and payment of the balance.\n\n6.3 In a final judgment where an interim payment has previously been made which is more than the total amount awarded by the judge, the judgment or order should set out in a preamble;\n\n(1) the total amount awarded by the judge, and\n\n(2) the amount and date of the interim payment(s).\n\n6.4 An order should then be made for repayment, reimbursement, variation or discharge under rule 25.20(6) and for interest on an overpayment under rule 25.20(8).\n\n---\n\nStatement as to service of a claim form\n\n7.1 Where a party to proceedings which have gone to trial requires a statement to be included in the judgment as to where, and by what means the claim form issued in those proceedings was served, application should made to the trial judge when judgment is given.\n\n7.2 If the judge so orders, the statement will be included in a preamble to the judgment as entered.\n\n---\n\nOrders requiring an act to be done\n\n8.1 An order which requires an act to be done (other than a judgment or order for the payment of an amount of money) must specify the time within which the act should be done.\n\n8.2 The consequences of failure to do an act within the time specified may be set out in the order. In this case the wording of the following examples suitably adapted must be used:\n\n(1) Unless the [claimant][defendant] serves his list of documents by 4.00 p.m. on Friday, January 22, 1999 his [claim][defence] will be struck out and judgment entered for the [defendant][claimant], or\n\n(2) Unless the [claimant][defendant] serves his list of documents within 14 days of service of this order his [claim][defence] will be struck out and judgment entered for the [defendant][claimant].\n\nExample (1) should be used wherever possible.\n\n---\n\nNon-compliance with an injunction or undertaking\n\n9 Part 81 deals with applications and proceedings in relation to contempt of court. Rule 81.4(2)(e) requires that a contempt application must include a statement that an order allegedly breached or disobeyed included a penal notice.\n\n---\n\nForeign currency\n\n10 Where judgment is ordered to be entered in a foreign currency, the order should be in the following form:\n\nIt is ordered that the defendant pay the claimant (state the sum in the foreign currency) or the Sterling equivalent at the time of payment.\n\n---\n\nCosts\n\n11.1 Attention is drawn to-\n\n(1) Practice Direction 44 - General Rules about Costs and, in particular to Subsections 8 and 9 of that Practice Direction which relate to the court's power to make a summary assessment of costs; and\n\n(2) rule 47.20 and Practice Direction 47 - Procedure for Detailed Assessment of Costs and Default Provisions, and in particular the provisions relating to interest in detailed assessment proceedings.\n\n11.2 Attention is also drawn to costs rule 44.10(1) which provides that if an order makes no mention of costs, none are payable in respect of the proceedings to which it relates.\n\n---\n\nJudgments paid by instalments\n\n12 Where a judgment is to be paid by instalments, the judgment should set out:\n\n(1) the total amount of the judgment,\n\n(2) the amount of each instalment,\n\n(3) the number of instalments and the date on which each is to be paid, and\n\n(4) to whom the instalments should be paid.\n\n---\n\nOrder to make an order of the Supreme Court an order of the High Court\n\n13.1 Application may be made in accordance with Part 23 for an order to make an order of the Supreme Court an order of the High Court. The application should be made to the procedural judge of the Division, District Registry or court in which the proceedings are taking place and may be made without notice unless the court directs otherwise.\n\n13.2 The application must be supported by the following evidence:\n\n(1) details of the order which was the subject of the appeal to the Supreme Court,\n\n(2) details of the order of the Supreme Court, with a copy annexed, and\n\n(3) a copy annexed of the certificate of the Registrar of the Supreme Court of the assessment of the costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court in the sum of £…………..\n\n13.3 The order to make an order of the Supreme Court an order of the High Court should be in form no PF 68.\n\n---\n\nExamples of forms of trial judgment\n\n14.1 The following general forms may be used;\n\n(1) judgment after trial before judge without jury - form no 45,\n\n(2) judgment after trial before judge with jury - form no 46,\n\n(3) judgment after trial before a Master or district judge - form no 47,\n\n(4) judgment after trial before a judge of the Technology and Construction court - form no 47 but with any necessary modifications.\n\n14.2 A trial judgment should, in addition to the matters set out in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 above, have the following matters set out in a preamble:\n\n(1) the questions put to a jury and their answers to those questions,\n\n(2) the findings of a jury and whether unanimous or by a majority,\n\n(3) any order made during the course of the trial concerning the use of evidence,\n\n(4) any matters that were agreed between the parties prior to or during the course of the trial in respect of\n\n(a) liability,\n\n(b) contribution,\n\n(c) the amount of the damages or part of the damages, and\n\n(5) the findings of the judge in respect of each head of damage in a personal injury case.\n\n14.3 Form no 49 should be used for a trial judgment against an Estate.\n\n14.4 On any application or appeal concerning -\n\n(i) a committal order;\n\n(ii) a refusal to grant habeas corpus or\n\n(iii) a secure accommodation order made under section 25 of the Children Act 1989,\n\nif the court ordering the release of the person concludes that his Convention rights have been infringed by the making of the order to which the application or appeal relates, the judgment or order should so state.

The purpose of the scheme is to enable the Ministry of Justice to collate and publish, in anonymised form, information about applications for non-disclosure orders where section 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is engaged.\n\nThe scheme applies in any civil proceedings in the High Court or Court of Appeal in which the court considers an application for a non-disclosure order in civil proceedings to restrain the publication of private or confidential information., the continuation of such a non-disclosure order, or an appeal against the grant or refusal of such a non-disclosure order. The scheme does not apply to proceedings to which the Family Procedure Rules 2010 or the Court of Protection Rules 2017 apply, to immigration or asylum proceedings, to proceedings which raise issues of national security or to proceedings to which Part 21 applies.\n\nExcept where a direction under paragraph 6 is made, following the hearing of an application for a non-disclosure order or any appeal against the grant or refusal of any such non-disclosure order-\n\n(a) the legal representatives for the claimant and defendant will agree the information to be included in the Privacy Injunctions Statistics Form in the Annex to this practice direction (\"the Form\") and the claimant's legal representatives should send the completed Form to the judge or judge's clerk;\n\n(b) the judge will review and record the information specified in paragraph 4 (the information) in a final version of the Form.\n\nThe information to be included in the Form is-\n\n(a) the application number, parties and claim title (anonymised where appropriate);\n\n(b) whether the hearing was of-\n\n(i) an application for an interim non-disclosure order;\n\n(ii) an application for an extension or variation of an interim non-disclosure order or an undertaking to the court;\n\n(iii) an application for a final non-disclosure order; or\n\n(iv) an appeal against the grant or refusal of an interim or final non-disclosure order;\n\n(c) whether the hearing was on notice, or without notice to-\n\n(i) the defendant; or\n\n(ii) any third party liable to be affected by the order;\n\n(d) whether the parties consented to the order;\n\n(e) whether the defendant was-\n\n(i) a news media organisation;\n\n(ii) a social media platform;\n\n(iii) a search engine;\n\n(iv) an individual publisher;\n\n(v) other - please specify;\n\n(f) whether the claimant notified a third party that was-\n\n(i) a news media organisation;\n\n(ii) a social media platform;\n\n(iii) a search engine;\n\n(iv) an individual publisher;\n\n(v) other - please specify;\n\n(g) whether any derogations from the principle of open justice were sought, and if so-\n\n(i) what they were;\n\n(ii) whether they were granted;\n\n(iii) if granted whether with the parties' consent.\n\nDerogations from the principle of open justice include, but are not limited to-\n\n(a) an order that the hearing be held wholly or partly in private;\n\n(b) an order that the names of one or more of the parties not be disclosed;\n\n(c) an order that access to documents on the court file be restricted (under rule 5.4 C or the inherent jurisdiction);\n\n(d) an order that the provision of documents to third parties be restricted (under rule 25.11); and\n\n(e) an order prohibiting disclosure of the existence of the proceedings or the order.\n\n(Rule 39.2 provides for the general rule that a hearing is to be in public, and for the circumstances in which a hearing must be held in private.)\n\nSubject to any express direction to the contrary in the order, any order made by the court on an application for a non-disclosure order or appeal from the grant or refusal of such a non-disclosure order shall be deemed to include a provision giving permission to a court officer to transmit the information to the Chief Statistician in the Ministry of Justice in order for it to be analysed and published in such form as does not enable the public identification of the parties to any proceedings.\n\nIf, in exceptional circumstances, the judge makes any direction under paragraph 6, the judge shall report that fact, and the nature of any derogation from open justice contained in the non-disclosure order, to the Master of the Rolls. The Master of the Rolls is , following consultation with the judge, entitled to transmit such information as the Master of the Rolls sees fit to the Chief Statistician to enable publication by the Ministry of Justice of the bare fact that a non-disclosure order of that type has been made.\n\nOnce the final version of the Form has been completed, the judge will send it or cause it to be sent to the Chief Statistician at the Ministry of Justice.\n\n---\n\nAnnex\n\nHigh Court and Court of Appeal privacy injunctions statistics form(PDF 0.03 mb)",

Costs which are disproportionate in amount may be disallowed or reduced even if they were reasonably or necessarily incurred; and\n\n(b) resolve any doubt which it may have as to whether costs were reasonably and proportionately incurred or were reasonable and proportionate in amount in favour of the paying party.\n\n(Factors which the court may take into account are set out in rule 44.4.)\n\n(3) Where the amount of costs is to be assessed on the indemnity basis, the court will resolve any doubt which it may have as to whether costs were reasonably incurred or were reasonable in amount in favour of the receiving party.\n\n(4) Where -\n\n(a) the court makes an order about costs without indicating the basis on which the costs are to be assessed; or\n\n(b) the court makes an order for costs to be assessed on a basis other than the standard basis or the indemnity basis,\n\nthe costs will be assessed on the standard basis.\n\n(5) Costs incurred are proportionate if they bear a reasonable relationship to -\n\n(a) the sums in issue in the proceedings;\n\n(b) the value of any non-monetary relief in issue in the proceedings;\n\n(c) the complexity of the litigation;\n\n(d) any additional work generated by the conduct of the paying party,\n\n(e) any wider factors involved in the proceedings, such as reputation or public importance; and\n\n(f) any additional work undertaken or expense incurred due to the vulnerability of a party or any witness.\n\n(6) Where the amount of a solicitor's remuneration in respect of non-contentious business is regulated by any general orders made under the Solicitors Act 19744,the amount of the costs to be allowed in respect of any such business which falls to be assessed by the court will be decided in accordance with those general orders rather than this rule and rule 44.4.\n\n(7) Paragraphs (2)(a) and (5) do not apply in relation to -\n\n(a) cases commenced before 1 st April 2013; or\n\n(b) costs incurred in respect of work done before 1 st April 2013,\n\nand in relation to such cases or costs, rule 44.4.(2)(a) as it was in force immediately before 1 st April 2013 will apply instead.\n\n---\n\nFactors to be taken into account in deciding the amount of costs\n\n44.4\n\n(1) The court will have regard to all the circumstances in deciding whether costs were -\n\n(a) if it is assessing costs on the standard basis -\n\n(i) proportionately and reasonably incurred; or\n\n(ii) proportionate and reasonable in amount, or\n\n(b) if it is assessing costs on the indemnity basis -\n\n(i) unreasonably incurred; or\n\n(ii) unreasonable in amount.\n\n(2) In particular, the court will give effect to any orders which have already been made.\n\n(3) The court will also have regard to -\n\n(a) the conduct of all the parties, including in particular -\n\n(i) conduct before, as well as during, the proceedings; and\n\n(ii) the efforts made, if any, before and during the proceedings in order to try to resolve the dispute;\n\n(b) the amount or value of any money or property involved;\n\n(c) the importance of the matter to all the parties;\n\n(d) the particular complexity of the matter or the difficulty or novelty of the questions raised;\n\n(e) the skill, effort, specialised knowledge and responsibility involved;\n\n(f) the time spent on the case;\n\n(g) the place where and the circumstances in which work or any part of it was done; and\n\n(h) the receiving party's last approved or agreed budget.\n\n(Rule 35.4(4) gives the court power to limit the amount that a party may recover with regard to the fees and expenses of an expert.)\n\n---\n\nAmount of costs where costs are payable under a contract\n\n44.5\n\n(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), where the court assesses (whether by summary or detailed assessment) costs which are payable by the paying party to the receiving party under the terms of a contract, the costs payable under those terms are, unless the contract expressly provides otherwise, to be presumed to be costs which -\n\n(a) have been reasonably incurred; and\n\n(b) are reasonable in amount,\n\nand the court will assess them accordingly.\n\n(2) The presumptions in paragraph (1) are rebuttable. Practice Direction 44 - General rules about costs sets out circumstances where the court may order otherwise.\n\n(3) Paragraph (1) does not apply where the contract is between a solicitor and client.\n\n---\n\nProcedure for assessing costs\n\n44.6\n\n(1) Where the court orders a party to pay costs to another party (other than fixed costs) it may -\n\n(a) make a summary assessment of the costs;\n\n(b) give directions for the summary assessment of the costs to be made at a later date; or\n\n(c) order detailed assessment of the costs by a costs officer,\n\nunless any rule, practice direction or other enactment provides otherwise.\n\n(Practice Direction 44 - General rules about costs sets out the factors which will affect the court's decision under paragraph (1).)\n\n(2) Where a direction has been given under paragraph (1)(b), another judge who could have decided the claim or application which gave rise to the costs order may make the summary assessment if there is good reason to do so.\n\n(3) A party may recover the fixed costs specified in Part 45 in accordance with that Part.\n\n---\n\nTime for complying with an order for costs\n\n44.7\n\n(1) A party must comply with an order for the payment of costs within 14 days of -\n\n(a) the date of the judgment or order if it states the amount of those costs;\n\n(b) if the amount of those costs (or part of them) is decided later in accordance with Part 47, the date of the certificate which states the amount; or\n\n(c) in either case, such other date as the court may specify.\n\n(Part 47 sets out the procedure for detailed assessment of costs.)\n\n---\n\nLegal representative's duty to notify the party\n\n44.8 Where -\n\n(a) the court makes a costs order against a legally represented party; and\n\n(b) the party is not present when the order is made,\n\nthe party's legal representative must notify that party in writing of the costs order no later than 7 days after the legal representative receives notice of the order.\n\n(Paragraph 10.1 of Practice Direction 44 defines 'party' for the purposes of this rule.)\n\n---\n\nCases where costs orders deemed to have been made\n\n44.9\n\n(1) Subject to paragraph (2), where a right to costs arises under -\n\n(a) rule 3.7 or 3.7 A 1 (defendant's right to costs where claim is struck out for non-payment of fees);\n\n(a 1) rule 3.7 B (sanctions for dishonouring cheque);\n\n(b) rule 36.13(1) or (2) (claimant's entitlement to costs where a Part 36 offer is accepted); or\n\n(c) rule 38.6 (defendant's right to costs where claimant discontinues),\n\na costs order will be deemed to have been made on the standard basis, save that where the claim is one to which the provisions of Part 27 or Part 45 would otherwise apply, the costs shall be determined in accordance with those Parts.\n\n(2) Paragraph 1(b) does not apply where a Part 36 offer is accepted before the commencement of proceedings.\n\n(3) Where such an order is deemed to be made in favour of a party with pro bono representation, that party may apply for an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act.\n\n(4) Interest payable under section 17 of the Judgments Act 18385 or section 74 of the County Courts Act 19846 on the costs deemed to have been ordered under paragraph (1) will begin to run from the date on which the event which gave rise to the entitlement to costs occurred.\n\n---\n\nWhere the court makes no order for costs\n\n44.10\n\n(1) Where the court makes an order which does not mention costs -\n\n(a) subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the general rule is that no party is entitled -\n\n(i) to costs; or\n\n(ii) to seek an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act,\n\nin relation to that order; but\n\n(b) this does not affect any entitlement of a party to recover costs out of a fund held by that party as trustee or personal representative, or under any lease, mortgage or other security.\n\n(2) Where the court makes -\n\n(a) an order granting permission to appeal;\n\n(b) an order granting permission to apply for judicial review; or\n\n(c) any other order or direction sought by a party on an application without notice,\n\nand its order does not mention costs, it will be deemed to include an order for applicant's costs in the case.\n\n(3) Any party affected by a deemed order for costs under paragraph (2) may apply at any time to vary the order.\n\n(4) The court hearing an appeal may, unless it dismisses the appeal, make orders about the costs of the proceedings giving rise to the appeal as well as the costs of the appeal.\n\n(5) Subject to any order made by the transferring court, where proceedings are transferred from one court to another, the court to which they are transferred may deal with all the costs, including the costs before the transfer.\n\n---\n\nCourt's powers in relation to misconduct\n\n44.11\n\n(1) The court may make an order under this rule where -\n\n(a) a party or that party's legal representative, in connection with a summary or detailed assessment, fails to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order; or\n\n(b) it appears to the court that the conduct of a party or that party's legal representative, before or during the proceedings or in the assessment proceedings, was unreasonable or improper.\n\n(2) Where paragraph (1) applies, the court may -\n\n(a) disallow all or part of the costs which are being assessed; or\n\n(b) order the party at fault or that party's legal representative to pay costs which that party or legal representative has caused any other party to incur.\n\n(3) Where -\n\n(a) the court makes an order under paragraph (2) against a legally represented party; and\n\n(b) the party is not present when the order is made,\n\nthe party's legal representative must notify that party in writing of the order no later than 7 days after the legal representative receives notice of the order.\n\n---\n\nSet Off\n\n44.12\n\n(1) Where a party entitled to costs is also liable to pay costs, the court may assess the costs which that party is liable to pay and either -\n\n(a) set off the amount assessed against the amount the party is entitled to be paid and direct that party to pay any balance; or\n\n(b) delay the issue of a certificate for the costs to which the party is entitled until the party has paid the amount which that party is liable to pay\n\nII QUALIFIED ONE-WAY COSTS SHIFTING\n\n---\n\nQualified one-way costs shifting: scope and interpretation\n\n44.13\n\n(1) This Section applies to proceedings which include a claim for damages -\n\n(a) for personal injuries;\n\n(b) under the Fatal Accidents Act 19767;or\n\n(c) which arises out of death or personal injury and survives for the benefit of an estate by virtue of section 1(1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 19348,\n\nbut does not apply to applications pursuant to section 33 of the Senior Courts Act 19819 or section 52 of the County Courts Act 198410(applications for pre-action disclosure), or where rule 44.17 applies.\n\n(2) In this Section, 'claimant' means a person bringing a claim to which this Section applies or an estate on behalf of which such a claim is brought, and includes a person making a counterclaim or an additional claim.\n\n---\n\nEffect of qualified one-way costs shifting\n\n44.14\n\n(1) Subject to rules 44.15 and 44.16, orders for costs made against a claimant may be enforced without the permission of the court but only to the extent that the aggregate amount in money terms of such orders does not exceed the aggregate amount in money terms of any orders for, or agreements to pay or settle a claim for, damages, costs and interest made in favour of the claimant.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this Section, orders for costs includes orders for costs deemed to have been made (either against the claimant or in favour of the claimant) as set out in rule 44.9.\n\n(3) Orders for costs made against a claimant may only be enforced after the proceedings have been concluded and the costs have been assessed or agreed.\n\n(4) Where enforcement is permitted against any order for costs made in favour of the claimant, rule 44.12 applies.\n\n(5) An order for costs which is enforced only to the extent permitted by paragraph (1) shall not be treated as an unsatisfied or outstanding judgment for the purposes of any court record.\n\n---\n\nExceptions to qualified one-way costs shifting where permission not required\n\n44.15 Orders for costs made against the claimant may be enforced to the full extent of such orders without the permission of the court where the proceedings have been struck out on the grounds that -\n\n(a) the claimant has disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the proceedings;\n\n(b) the proceedings are an abuse of the court's process; or\n\n(c) the conduct of -\n\n(i) the claimant; or\n\n(ii) a person acting on the claimant's behalf and with the claimant's knowledge of such conduct,\n\nis likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings.\n\n---\n\nExceptions to qualified one-way costs shifting where permission required\n\n44.16\n\n(1) Orders for costs made against the claimant may be enforced to the full extent of such orders with the permission of the court where the claim is found on the balance of probabilities to be fundamentally dishonest.\n\n(2) Orders for costs made against the claimant may be enforced up to the full extent of such orders with the permission of the court, and to the extent that it considers just, where -\n\n(a) the proceedings include a claim which is made for the financial benefit of a person other than the claimant or a dependant within the meaning of section 1(3) of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (other than a claim in respect of the gratuitous provision of care, earnings paid by an employer or medical expenses); or\n\n(b) a claim is made for the benefit of the claimant other than a claim to which this Section applies.\n\n(3) Where paragraph (2)(a) applies, the court may, subject to rule 46.2, make an order for costs against a person, other than the claimant, for whose financial benefit the whole or part of the claim was made.\n\n---\n\nTransitional provision\n\n44.17 This Section does not apply to proceedings where the claimant has entered into a pre-commencement funding arrangement (as defined in rule 48.2).\n\nIII DAMAGES-BASED AGREEMENTS\n\n---\n\nAward of costs where there is a damages-based agreement\n\n44.18\n\n(1) The fact that a party has entered into a damages-based agreement will not affect the making of any order for costs which otherwise would be made in favour of that party.\n\n(2) Where costs are to be assessed in favour of a party who has entered into a damages-based agreement -\n\n(a) the party's recoverable costs will be assessed in accordance with rule 44.3; and\n\n(b) the party may not recover by way of costs more than the total amount payable by that party under the damages-based agreement for legal services provided under that agreement.\n\n---\n\nFootnotes\n\n• 1990 c.41.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 44 - GENERAL RULES ABOUT COSTS\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements Part 44\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\nSECTION I - GENERAL\n\nDocuments and forms\n\n---\n\n1.1\n\nIn respect of any document which is required by Practice Directions 44 to 47 to be signed by a party or that party's legal representative, the provisions of Part 22 and Practice Direction 22 relating to who may sign apply as if the document in question was a statement of truth. Statements of truth are not required in assessment proceedings unless a rule or Practice Direction so requires or the court so orders.\n\n---\n\n1.2\n\nForm N 260 is a model form of Statement of Costs to be used for summary assessments.\n\n(Further details about Statements of Costs are given in paragraph 9.5 below.)\n\nPrecedents A, B and C in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction are model forms of bills of costs to be used for detailed assessments. A party wishing to rely upon a bill which departs from the model forms should include in the background information of the bill an explanation for that departure.\n\n(Further details about bills of costs are given in Practice Direction 47.)\n\n---\n\nSpecial provisions relating to VAT\n\nScope of this subsection\n\n2.1\n\nThis subsection deals with claims for VAT) which are made in respect of costs being dealt with by way of summary assessment or detailed assessment.\n\nVAT Registration Number\n\n---\n\n2.2\n\nThe number allocated by HMRC to every person registered under the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (except a Government Department) must appear in a prominent place at the head of every statement, bill of costs, fee sheet, account or voucher on which VAT is being included as part of a claim for costs.\n\nEntitlement to VAT on Costs\n\n---\n\n2.3\n\nVAT should not be included in a claim for costs if the receiving party is able to recover the VAT as input tax. Where the receiving party is able to obtain credit from HMRC for a proportion of the VAT as input tax, only that proportion which is not eligible for credit should be included in the claim for costs.\n\n2.4\n\nThe receiving party has responsibility for ensuring that VAT is claimed only when the receiving party is unable to recover the VAT or a proportion thereof as input tax.\n\n---\n\n2.5\n\nWhere there is a dispute as to whether VAT is properly claimed the receiving party must provide a certificate signed by the legal representatives or the auditors of the receiving party substantially in the form illustrated in Precedent F in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to Practice Direction 47. Where the receiving party is a litigant in person who is claiming VAT, evidence to support the claim (such as a letter from HMRC) must be produced at the hearing at which the costs are assessed.\n\n---\n\n2.6\n\nWhere there is a dispute as to whether any service in respect of which a charge is proposed to be made in the bill is zero rated or exempt from VAT, reference should be made to HMRC and its view obtained and made known at the hearing at which the costs are assessed. Such enquiry should be made by the receiving party. In the case of a bill from a solicitor to the solicitor's legal representative's own client, such enquiry should be made by the client.\n\n---\n\nForm of bill of costs where VAT rate changes\n\n2.7\n\nWhere there is a change in the rate of VAT, suppliers of goods and services are entitled by sections 88 (1) and 88(2) of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 in most circumstances to elect whether the new or the old rate of VAT should apply to a supply where the basic and actual tax points span a period during which the rate changed.\n\n---\n\n2.8\n\nIt will be assumed, unless a contrary indication is given in writing, that an election to take advantage of the provisions mentioned in paragraph 2.7 and to charge VAT at the lower rate has been made. In any case in which an election to charge at the lower rate is not made, such a decision must be justified to the court assessing the costs.\n\nApportionment\n\n---\n\n2.9\n\nSubject to 2.7 and 2.8, all bills of costs, fees and disbursements on which VAT is included must be divided into separate parts so as to show work done before, on and after the date or dates from which any change in the rate of VAT takes effect. Where, however, a lump sum charge is made for work which spans a period during which there has been a change in VAT rates, and paragraphs 2.7 and 2.8 above do not apply, reference should be made to paragraphs 30.7 or 30.8 of the VAT Guide (Notice 700) (or any revised edition of that notice) published by HMRC. If necessary, the lump sum should be apportioned. The totals of profit costs and disbursements in each part must be carried separately to the summary.\n\n---\n\nChange in VAT rate between the conclusion of a detailed settlement and the issue of a final certificate\n\n2.10\n\nShould there be a change in the rate between the conclusion of a detailed assessment and the issue of the final costs certificate, any interested party may apply for the detailed assessment to be varied so as to take account of any increase or reduction in the amount of tax payable. Once the final costs certificate has been issued, no variation under this paragraph will be permitted.\n\n---\n\nDisbursements not classified as such for VAT purposes\n\n---\n\n2.11\n\n(1) Legal representatives often make payments to third parties for the supply of goods or services where no VAT was chargeable on the supply by the third party: for example, the cost of meals taken and travel costs. The question whether legal representatives should include VAT in respect of these payments when invoicing their clients or in claims for costs between litigants should be decided in accordance with this Practice Direction and with the criteria set out in the VAT Guide (Notice 700).\n\n(2) Payments to third parties which are normally treated as part of the legal representative's overheads (for example, postage costs and telephone costs) will not be treated as disbursements. The third party supply should be included as part of the costs of the legal representatives' legal services and VAT must be added to the total bill charged to the client.\n\n(3) Disputes may arise in respect of payments made to a third party which the legal representative shows as disbursements in the invoice delivered to the receiving party. Some payments, although correctly described as disbursements for some purposes, are not classified as disbursements for VAT purposes. Items not classified as disbursements for VAT purposes must be shown as part of the services provided by the legal representative and, therefore, VAT must be added in respect of them whether or not VAT was chargeable on the supply by the third party.\n\n(4) Guidance as to the circumstances in which disbursements may or may not be classified as disbursements for VAT purposes is given in the VAT Guide (Notice 700, paragraph 25.1). One of the key issues is whether the third party supply -\n\n(a) was made to the legal representative (and therefore subsumed in the onward supply of legal services); or\n\n(b) was made direct to the receiving party (the third party having no right to demand payment from the legal representative, who makes the payment only as agent for the receiving party).\n\n(5) Examples of payments under subparagraph (4)(a) are: travelling expenses, such as an airline ticket, and subsistence expenses, such as the cost of meals, where the person travelling and receiving the meals is the legal representative. The supplies by the airline and the restaurant are supplies to the legal representative, not to the client\n\n(6) Payments under subparagraph (4)(b) are classified as disbursements for VAT purposes and, therefore, the legal representative need not add VAT in respect of them. Simple examples are payments by a legal representative of court fees and payment of fees to an expert witness.\n\n---\n\nLitigants in person\n\n2.12\n\nWhere a litigant acts in person, that litigant is not treated for the purposes of VAT as having supplied services and therefore no VAT is chargeable in respect of work done by that litigant (even where, for example, that litigant is a solicitor or other legal representative). Consequently in such circumstances a bill of costs should not claim any VAT.\n\nGovernment Departments\n\n---\n\n2.13\n\nOn an assessment between parties, where costs are being paid to a Government Department in respect of services rendered by its legal staff, VAT should not be added.\n\nPayment pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act\n\n2.14\n\nWhere an order is made under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act, any bill presented for agreement or assessment pursuant to that order must not include a claim for VAT.\n\nCosts budgets\n\n---\n\n3.1\n\nIn any case where the parties have filed budgets in accordance with Practice Direction 3 D but the court has not made a costs management order under rule 3.15, the provisions of this subsection shall apply.\n\n3.2\n\nIf there is a difference of 20% or more between the costs claimed by a receiving party on detailed assessment and the costs shown in a budget filed by that party, the receiving party must provide a statement of the reasons for the difference with the bill of costs.\n\n---\n\n3.3\n\nIf a paying party -\n\n(a) claims to have reasonably relied on a budget filed by a receiving party; or\n\n(b) wishes to rely upon the costs shown in the budget in order to dispute the reasonableness or proportionality of the costs claimed,\n\nthe paying party must serve a statement setting out the case in this regard in that party's points of dispute.\n\n---\n\n3.4\n\nOn an assessment of the costs of a party, the court will have regard to the last approved or agreed budget, and may have regard to any other budget previously filed by that party, or by any other party in the same proceedings. Such other budgets may be taken into account when assessing the reasonableness and proportionality of any costs claimed.\n\n---\n\n3.5\n\nSubject to paragraph 3.4, paragraphs 3.6 and 3.7 apply where there is a difference of 20% or more between the costs claimed by a receiving party and the costs shown in a budget filed by that party.\n\n---\n\n3.6\n\nWhere it appears to the court that the paying party reasonably relied on the budget, the court may restrict the recoverable costs to such sum as is reasonable for the paying party to pay in the light of that reliance, notwithstanding that such sum is less than the amount of costs reasonably and proportionately incurred by the receiving party.\n\n---\n\n3.7\n\nWhere it appears to the court that the receiving party has not provided a satisfactory explanation for that difference, the court may regard the difference between the costs claimed and the costs shown in the budget as evidence that the costs claimed are unreasonable or disproportionate.\n\nCourt's discretion as to costs: rule 44.2\n\n4.1\n\nThe court may make an order about costs at any stage in a case.\n\n---\n\n4.2\n\nThere are certain costs orders which the court will commonly make in proceedings before trial. The following table sets out the general effect of these orders. The table is not an exhaustive list of the orders which the court may make.\n\nCosts\n\nCosts in any event\n\nCosts in the case\n\nCosts in the application\n\nCosts reserved\n\nClaimant's/Defendant's costs in case/application\n\nCosts thrown away\n\n• preparing for and attending any hearing at which the judgment or order which has been set aside was made;\n• preparing for and attending any hearing to set aside the judgment or order in question;\n• preparing for and attending any hearing at which the court orders the proceedings or the part in question to be adjourned;\n• any steps taken to enforce a judgment or order which has subsequently been set aside.\n\nCosts of and caused by\n\nCosts here and below\n\nNo order as to costs\n\nEach party to pay own costs\n\n---\n\nFees of Counsel\n\n---\n\n5.1\n\n(1) When making an order for costs the court may state an opinion as to whether or not the hearing was fit for the attendance of one or more counsel, and, if it does so, the court conducting a detailed assessment of those costs will have regard to the opinion stated.\n\n(2) The court will generally express an opinion only where -\n\n(a) the paying party asks it to do so;\n\n(b) more than one counsel appeared for a party; or\n\n(c) the court wishes to record its opinion that the case was not fit for the attendance of counsel.\n\n---\n\n5.2\n\n(1) Where the court refers any matter to the conveyancing counsel of the court the fees payable to counsel in respect of the work done or to be done will be assessed by the court in accordance with rule 44.2.\n\n(2) An appeal from a decision of the court in respect of the fees of such counsel will be dealt with under the general rules as to appeals set out in Part 52. If the appeal is against the decision of an authorised court officer, it will be dealt with in accordance with rules 47.22 to 47.24.\n\n---\n\nBasis of assessment: rule 44.3\n\nCosts on the indemnity basis\n\n6.1\n\nIf costs are awarded on the indemnity basis, the court assessing costs will disallow any costs -\n\n(a) which it finds to have been unreasonably incurred; or\n\n(b) which it considers to be unreasonable in amount.\n\nCosts on the standard basis\n\n---\n\n6.2\n\nIf costs are awarded on the standard basis, the court assessing costs will disallow any costs -\n\n(a) which it finds to have been unreasonably incurred;\n\n(b) which it considers to be unreasonable in amount;\n\n(c) which it considers to have been disproportionately incurred or to be disproportionate in amount; or\n\n(d) about which it has doubts as to whether they were reasonably or proportionately incurred, or whether they are reasonable and proportionate in amount.\n\n---\n\nAmount of costs where costs are payable pursuant to a contract: rule 44.5\n\nApplication of rule 44.5\n\n7.1\n\nRule 44.5 only applies if the court is assessing costs payable under a contract. It does not -\n\n(a) require the court to make an assessment of such costs; or\n\n(b) require a mortgagee to apply for an order for those costs where there is a contractual right to recover out of the mortgage funds.\n\nCosts relating to a mortgage\n\n---\n\n7.2\n\n(1) The following principles apply to costs relating to a mortgage.\n\n(2) An order for the payment of costs of proceedings by one party to another is always a discretionary order: section 51 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 ('the section 51 discretion').\n\n(3) Where there is a contractual right to the costs, the discretion should ordinarily be exercised so as to reflect that contractual right.\n\n(4) The power of the court to disallow a mortgagee's costs sought to be added to the mortgage security is a power that does not derive from section 51, but from the power of the courts of equity to fix the terms on which redemption will be allowed.\n\n(5) A decision by a court to refuse costs in whole or in part to a mortgagee may be -\n\n(a) a decision in the exercise of the section 51 discretion;\n\n(b) a decision in the exercise of the power to fix the terms on which redemption will be allowed;\n\n(c) a decision as to the extent of a mortgagee's contractual right to add the mortgagee's costs to the security; or\n\n(d) a combination of two or more of these things.\n\n(6) A mortgagee is not to be deprived of a contractual or equitable right to add costs to the security merely by reason of an order for payment of costs made without reference to the mortgagee's contractual or equitable rights, and without any adjudication as to whether or not the mortgagee should be deprived of those costs.\n\n---\n\n7.3\n\n(1) Where the contract entitles a mortgagee to -\n\n(a) add the costs of litigation relating to the mortgage to the sum secured by it; or\n\n(b) require a mortgagor to pay those costs,\n\nthe mortgagor may make an application for the court to direct that an account of the mortgagee's costs be taken.\n\n(Rule 25.1(1)(o) provides that the court may direct that a party file an account.)\n\n(2) The mortgagor may then dispute an amount in the mortgagee's account on the basis that it has been unreasonably incurred or is unreasonable in amount.\n\n(3) Where a mortgagor disputes an amount, the court may make an order that the disputed costs are assessed under rule 44.5.\n\n---\n\nProcedure for assessing costs: rule 44.6\n\n8.1\n\nSubject to paragraph 8.3, where the court does not order fixed costs (or no fixed costs are provided for) the amount of costs payable will be assessed by the court. Rule 44.6 allows the court making an order about costs either -\n\n(a) to make a summary assessment of the amount of the costs; or\n\n(b) to order the amount to be decided in accordance with Part 47 (a detailed assessment).\n\n---\n\n8.2\n\nAn order for costs will be treated as an order for the amount of costs to be decided by a detailed assessment unless the order otherwise provides.\n\n8.3\n\nWhere a party is entitled to costs some of which are fixed costs and some of which are not, the court will assess those costs which are not fixed. The decision whether such assessment should be summary or detailed will be made in accordance with paragraphs 9.1 to 9.10 of this Practice Direction.\n\nSummary assessment: general provisions\n\n---\n\nWhen the court should consider whether to make a summary assessment\n\n9.1\n\nWhenever a court makes an order about costs which does not provide only for fixed costs to be paid the court should consider whether to make a summary assessment of costs.\n\nTiming of summary assessment\n\n---\n\n9.2\n\nThe general rule is that the court should make a summary assessment of the costs -\n\n(a) at the conclusion of the trial of a case which has been dealt with on the fast track, in which case the order will deal with the costs of the whole claim; and\n\n(b) at the conclusion of any other hearing, which has lasted not more than one day, in which case the order will deal with the costs of the application or matter to which the hearing related. If this hearing disposes of the claim, the order may deal with the costs of the whole claim,\n\nunless there is good reason not to do so, for example where the paying party shows substantial grounds for disputing the sum claimed for costs that cannot be dealt with summarily.\n\n---\n\nSummary assessment of mortgagee's costs\n\n9.3\n\nThe general rule in paragraph 9.2 does not apply to a mortgagee's costs incurred in mortgage possession proceedings or other proceedings relating to a mortgage unless the mortgagee asks the court to make an order for the mortgagee's costs to be paid by another party.\n\n(Paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3 deal in more detail with costs relating to mortgages.)\n\nConsent orders\n\n---\n\n9.4\n\nWhere an application has been made and the parties to the application agree an order by consent without any party attending, the parties should seek to agree a figure for costs to be inserted in the consent order or agree that there should be no order for costs.\n\nDuty of parties and legal representatives\n\n---\n\n9.5\n\n(1) It is the duty of the parties and their legal representatives to assist the judge in making a summary assessment of costs in any case to which paragraph 9.2 above applies, in accordance with the following subparagraphs.\n\n(2) Each party who intends to claim costs must prepare a written statement of those costs showing separately in the form of a schedule -\n\n(a) the number of hours to be claimed;\n\n(b) the hourly rate to be claimed;\n\n(c) the grade of fee earner;\n\n(d) the amount and nature of any disbursement to be claimed, other than counsel's fee for appearing at the hearing;\n\n(e) the amount of legal representative's costs to be claimed for attending or appearing at the hearing;\n\n(f) counsel's fees; and\n\n(g) any VAT to be claimed on these amounts.\n\n(3) The statement of costs should follow as closely as possible Form N 260 and must be signed by the party or the party's legal representative. Where a party is -\n\n(a) an assisted person;\n\n(b) a LSC funded client;\n\n(c) a person for whom civil legal services (within the meaning of Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012) are provided under arrangements made for the purposes of that Part of that Act; or\n\n(d) represented by a person in the party's employment,\n\nthe statement of costs need not include the certificate appended at the end of Form N 260.\n\n(4) The statement of costs must be filed at court and copies of it must be served on any party against whom an order for payment of those costs is intended to be sought as soon as possible and in any event -\n\n(a) for a fast track trial, not less than 2 days before the trial; and\n\n(b) for all other hearings, not less than 24 hours before the time fixed for the hearing.\n\n---\n\n9.6\n\nThe failure by a party, without reasonable excuse, to comply with paragraph 9.5 will be taken into account by the court in deciding what order to make about the costs of the claim, hearing or application, and about the costs of any further hearing or detailed assessment hearing that may be necessary as a result of that failure.\n\nNo summary assessment by a costs officer\n\n---\n\n9.7\n\nThe court awarding costs cannot make an order for a summary assessment of costs by a costs officer. If a summary assessment of costs is appropriate but the court awarding costs is unable to do so on the day, the court may give directions as to a further hearing before the same judge.\n\nAssisted persons etc\n\n---\n\n9.8\n\nThe court will not make a summary assessment of the costs of a receiving party who is an assisted person or LSC funded client or who is a person for whom civil legal services (within the meaning of Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012) are provided under arrangements made for the purposes of that Part of that Act.\n\nChildren or protected parties\n\n---\n\n9.9\n\n(1) The court will not make a summary assessment of the costs of a receiving party who is a child or protected party within the meaning of Part 21 unless the legal representative acting for the child or protected party has waived the right to further costs (see Practice Direction 46 paragraph 2.1).\n\n(2) The court may make a summary assessment of costs payable by a child or protected party.\n\nDisproportionate or unreasonable costs\n\n---\n\n9.10\n\nThe court will not give its approval to disproportionate or unreasonable costs. When the amount of the costs to be paid has been agreed between the parties the order for costs must state that the order is by consent.\n\nLegal representative's duty to notify party: rule 44.8\n\n---\n\n10.1\n\nFor the purposes of rule 44.8 and paragraph 10.2, 'party' includes any person (for example, an insurer, a trade union or the LSC or Lord Chancellor) who has instructed the legal representative to act for the party or who is liable to pay the legal representative's fees.\n\n10.2\n\nA legal representative who notifies a party of an order under rule 44.8 must also explain why the order came to be made.\n\n---\n\n10.3\n\nAlthough rule 44.8 does not specify any sanction for breach of the rule the court may, either in the order for costs itself or in a subsequent order, require the legal representative to produce to the court evidence showing that the legal representative took reasonable steps to comply with the rule.\n\nCourt's powers in relation to misconduct: rule 44.11\n\n---\n\n11.1\n\nBefore making an order under rule 44.11, the court must give the party or legal representative in question a reasonable opportunity to make written submissions or, if the legal representative so desires, to attend a hearing.\n\n11.2\n\nConduct which is unreasonable or improper includes steps which are calculated to prevent or inhibit the court from furthering the overriding objective.\n\n---\n\n11.3\n\nAlthough rule 44.11(3) does not specify any sanction for breach of the obligation imposed by the rule the court may, either in the order under rule 44.11(2) or in a subsequent order, require the legal representative to produce to the court evidence that the legal representative took reasonable steps to comply with the obligation.\n\nSECTION II - QUALIFIED ONE-WAY COSTS SHIFTING\n\nQualified one-way costs shifting\n\n---\n\n12.1\n\nThis subsection applies to proceedings to which Section II of Part 44 applies.\n\n12.2\n\nExamples of claims made for the financial benefit of a person other than the claimant or a dependant within the meaning of section 1(3) of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 within the meaning of rule 44.16(2) are subrogated claims and claims for credit hire.\n\n---\n\n12.3\n\n'Gratuitous provision of care' within the meaning of rule 44.16(2)(a) includes the provision of personal services rendered gratuitously by persons such as relatives and friends for things such as personal care, domestic assistance, childminding, home maintenance and decorating, gardening and chauffeuring.\n\n---\n\n12.4\n\nIn a case to which rule 44.16(1) applies (fundamentally dishonest claims) -\n\n(a) the court will normally direct that issues arising out of an allegation that the claim is fundamentally dishonest be determined at the trial;\n\n(b) where the proceedings have been settled, the court will not, save in exceptional circumstances, order that issues arising out of an allegation that the claim was fundamentally dishonest be determined in those proceedings;\n\n(c) where the claimant has served a notice of discontinuance, the court may direct that issues arising out of an allegation that the claim was fundamentally dishonest be determined notwithstanding that the notice has not been set aside pursuant to rule 38.4;\n\n(d) the court may, as it thinks fair and just, determine the costs attributable to the claim having been found to be fundamentally dishonest.\n\n---\n\n12.5\n\nThe court has power to make an order for costs against a person other than the claimant under section 51(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and rule 46.2. In a case to which rule 44.16(2)(a) applies (claims for the benefit of others) -\n\n(a) the court will usually order any person other than the claimant for whose financial benefit such a claim was made to pay all the costs of the proceedings or the costs attributable to the issues to which rule 44.16(2)(a) applies, or may exceptionally make such an order permitting the enforcement of such an order for costs against the claimant.\n\n(b) the court may, as it thinks fair and just, determine the costs attributable to claims for the financial benefit of persons other than the claimant.\n\n---\n\n12.6\n\nIn a case to which rule 44.16(1) or rule 44.16(2)(a) applies, the court will normally order the claimant or, as the case may be, the person for whose benefit a claim was made to pay costs notwithstanding that the aggregate amount in money terms of such orders exceeds the aggregate amount in money terms of any orders for damages, interest and costs made in favour of the claimant.\n\n---\n\n12.7\n\nAssessments of costs may be on a standard or indemnity basis and may be subject to a summary or detailed assessment.",

VAT\n\n45.2. Where appropriate, VAT may be recovered in addition to the amount of fixed in costs rules 45.8 and 45.15 A and in Section IV, Section VI, Section VII, Section VIII or Section X of this Part and any reference to fixed costs in those Sections is a reference to those costs net of any such VAT. Additional costs for work in specified areas ('London weighting')\n\n45.3.-(1) Where fixed costs are payable under Section IV, Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part and the receiving party-\n\n(a)lives, works or carries on business in any area set out in Section II of Practice Direction 45; and\n\n(b)instructs a legal representative with conduct of the litigation who practises in any of those areas,\n\nthe fixed costs shall include, in addition to the costs allowable in the relevant Section, an amount equal to 12.5% of those fixed costs ('London weighting').\n\n(2) In this rule 'fixed costs' excludes any disbursements. Litigants in person\n\n45.4.-(1) This rule applies to any claim where-\n\n(a)costs are payable under Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part; and\n\n(b)the party in whose favour the costs order is made is at any stage a litigant in person.\n\n(2) Where this rule applies-\n\n(a)rule 46.5 shall apply, save that-\n\n(i)where a party is a litigant in person throughout the entire claim, the costs allowed under this rule shall not exceed, except in the case of a disbursement, two-thirds of the fixed recoverable costs which would have been allowed under Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII if the litigant in person had been represented by a legal representative;\n\n(ii)for any stage in Table 12, Table 14 or Table 15 during which the party is for any period a litigant in person, the costs allowed for that stage shall not exceed two thirds of the costs so specified; and\n\n(iii)for any stage in Table 12, Table 14 or Table 15 during which a party is represented by a legal representative for the entire stage, the fixed recoverable costs shall apply as set out in sub-paragraph (b), provided that the total amount of costs to be allowed shall not exceed the costs which would have been allowed if the litigant in person had been represented by a legal representative for the entire claim;\n\n(b)where sub-paragraph (a)(iii) applies, the fixed recoverable costs shall be as follows-\n\n(i)where the stage provides only for a fixed sum, the fixed sum;\n\n(ii)in any other stage the difference between the fixed recoverable costs for that stage and the fixed recoverable costs for the last stage before that when the party was a litigant in person. Entitlement to costs - more than one claimant\n\n45.5.-(1) Unless paragraph (2) or paragraph (4) applies, where-\n\n(a)fixed costs are payable under Section VI or Section VII of this Part; and\n\n(b)orders for costs are made in favour of two or more claimants,\n\neach claimant is entitled to the costs of their own claim in accordance with the applicable rules in this Part.\n\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply where the claim is for a remedy to which the claimants are jointly entitled, and they are joined to the proceedings to comply with rule 19.3.\n\n(3) Paragraph (4) applies where fixed costs are payable under Section VI or Section VII and-\n\n(a)a legal representative with conduct of the litigation acts for more than one claimant in the proceedings;\n\n(b)each of those claimants has a separate claim against the defendant;\n\n(c)an order for costs is made in favour of two or more of those claimants; and\n\n(d)the court has ordered that paragraph (4) shall apply.\n\n(4) Where this paragraph applies-\n\n(a)the claimants in whose favour an order for costs is made shall only be entitled to one set of fixed costs;\n\n(b)the amount of the fixed costs to which those claimants are entitled is the sum of the allowable costs and the further amounts calculated in accordance with paragraph (5) and, where applicable, paragraph (7); and\n\n(c)those claimants are jointly entitled to any costs so ordered.\n\n(5) A further amount equal to 25% of the allowable costs is to be added for each additional claimant in whose favour the order for costs is made.\n\n(6) In paragraph (4), 'the allowable costs'-\n\n(a)means-\n\n(i)the applicable costs payable to the claimant in respect of whom the damages of highest value are agreed or awarded; or\n\n(ii)where paragraph (i) would apply to two or more claimants, the applicable costs payable to whichever one of those claimants their legal representative chooses;\n\n(b)does not include any additional costs under rule 36.24 or increased costs under rule 45.13(2); but\n\n(c)may include the relevant trial advocacy fees if applicable; and\n\n(d)excludes any disbursements.\n\n(7) In addition to the allowable costs under paragraph (4), those claimants who meet the criteria are entitled to London weighting.\n\n(8) Where one or more of the claimants referred to in paragraph (4) is entitled either to additional costs under rule 36.24(5) or increased costs under rule 45.13(2), or to both, the percentage increases for which those rules provide must be calculated by applying the relevant percentage to such proportion of the amount referred to in paragraph (4)(b) as reflects the proportion which each claimant so entitled bears to the total number of claimants to which paragraph (4) applies. Defendants' costs\n\n45.6.-(1) Where, in any case to which Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part applies, the court makes an order for costs in favour of the defendant, the allowable costs are-\n\n(a)the fixed costs set out in Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII;\n\n(b)the applicable disbursements set out in Section IX of this Part.\n\n(2) For the purpose of assessing or determining the costs payable to a defendant by reference to the fixed costs in Table 12 and Table 14-\n\n(a)\"value of the claim for damages\" and \"damages\" shall be treated as references to the value of the claim, as defined in paragraph (3); and\n\n(b)if the claim is discontinued, a reference in Table 12 or Table 14 to the stage at which a case is settled shall be treated as a reference to the stage at which the case is discontinued.\n\n(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), 'the value of the claim' is-\n\n(a)the amount specified in the claim form, without taking into account any deduction for contributory negligence, but excluding-\n\n(i)any amount not in dispute;\n\n(ii)interest; or\n\n(iii)costs;\n\n(b)if no amount is specified in the claim form, the maximum amount which the claimant reasonably expected to recover according to the statement of value included in the claim form under rule 16.3;\n\n(c)if the claim form states that the claimant cannot reasonably say how much is likely to be recovered-\n\n(i)£25,000 in a claim to which Section VI applies; or\n\n(ii)£100,000 in a claim to which Section VII applies;\n\n(d)if the claim has no monetary value-\n\n(i)the applicable amount in rule 45.45(1)(a)(ii) in a claim to which Section VI applies; or\n\n(ii)the applicable amount in rule 45.50(2)(b)(ii) in a claim to which Section VII applies; or\n\n(e)if a claim includes both a claim for monetary relief and a claim which has no monetary value, the applicable amount in sub-paragraph (d) taken together with the applicable monetary value in sub-paragraph (a), (b) or (c). Counterclaims\n\n45.7.-(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), if in any case to which Section VI or Section VII of this Part applies-\n\n(a)the defendant brings a counterclaim; and\n\n(b)the court makes an order for costs,\n\nrules 45.5, 45.6, 45.9, 45.10, 45.11, 45.12, 45.13, 45.43, 45.45, 45.46, 45.49 and 49.50 shall apply as if the counterclaim were a claim.\n\n(2) No costs are allowable under this rule where the only remedy sought by the counterclaimant is also a defence to the claim.\n\n(3) Where in a claim to which the RTA Protocol applies, there is a counterclaim which does not include a claim for personal injuries, any order for costs shall be for a sum equivalent to one half of the applicable Type A and Type B costs in Table 10. Pre-action and interim applications\n\n45.8.Where, in any claim to which Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part applies, the court makes an order for the costs of a pre-action or interim application, the costs which a party may be allowed are those set out in Table 1, together with any appropriate court fee.

or\n\n(ii) section 52 of the County Courts Act 1984,\n\n(which give the court powers exercisable before commencement of proceedings); or\n\n(b) for an order under -\n\n(i) section 34 of the Senior Courts Act 1981; or\n\n(ii) section 53 of the County Courts Act 1984,\n\n(which give the court power to make an order against a non-party for disclosure of documents, inspection of property etc.).\n\n(2) The general rule is that the court will award the person against whom the order is sought that person's costs -\n\n(a) of the application; and\n\n(b) of complying with any order made on the application.\n\n(3) The court may however make a different order, having regard to all the circumstances, including -\n\n(a) the extent to which it was reasonable for the person against whom the order was sought to oppose the application; and\n\n(b) whether the parties to the application have complied with any relevant pre-action protocol.\n\n---\n\nCosts orders in favour of or against non-parties\n\n46.2\n\n(1) Where the court is considering whether to exercise its power under section 51 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (costs are in the discretion of the court) to make a costs order in favour of or against a person who is not a party to proceedings, that person must -\n\n(a) be added as a party to the proceedings for the purposes of costs only; and\n\n(b) be given a reasonable opportunity to attend a hearing at which the court will consider the matter further.\n\n(2) This rule does not apply -\n\n(a) where the court is considering whether to -\n\n(i) make an order against the Lord Chancellor in proceedings in which the Lord Chancellor has provided legal aid to a party to the proceedings;\n\n(ii) make a wasted costs order (as defined in rule 46.8); and\n\n(b) in proceedings to which rule 46.1 applies (pre-commencement disclosure and orders for disclosure against a person who is not a party).\n\n(3) Neither rule 19.4 nor rule 20.7 applies to the joinder of a person under paragraph (1).\n\n---\n\nLimitations on court's power to award costs in favour of trustee or personal representative\n\n46.3\n\n(1) This rule applies where -\n\n(a) a person is or has been a party to any proceedings in the capacity of trustee or personal representative; and\n\n(b) rule 44.5 does not apply.\n\n(2) The general rule is that that person is entitled to be paid the costs of those proceedings, insofar as they are not recovered from or paid by any other person, out of the relevant trust fund or estate.\n\n(3) Where that person is entitled to be paid any of those costs out of the fund or estate, those costs will be assessed on the indemnity basis.\n\n---\n\nCosts where money is payable by or to a child or protected party\n\n46.4\n\n(1) This rule applies to any proceedings where a party is a child or protected party and -\n\n(a) money is ordered or agreed to be paid to, or for the benefit of, that party; or\n\n(b) money is ordered to be paid by that party or on that party's behalf.\n\n('Child' and 'protected party' have the same meaning as in rule 21.1(2).)\n\n(2) The general rule is that -\n\n(a) the court must order a detailed assessment of the costs payable by, or out of money belonging to, any party who is a child or protected party; and\n\n(b) on an assessment under paragraph (a), the court must also assess any costs payable to that party in the proceedings, unless -\n\n(i) the court has issued a default costs certificate in relation to those costs under rule 47.11; or\n\n(ii) the costs are payable in proceedings to which Section IV of Part 45 applies.\n\n(3) The court need not order detailed assessment of costs in the circumstances set out in paragraph (5) or in Practice Direction 46.\n\n(4) Where -\n\n(a) a claimant is a child or protected party; and\n\n(b) a detailed assessment has taken place under paragraph (2)(a),\n\nthe only amount payable by the child or protected party is the amount which the court certifies as payable.\n\n(5) Where the costs payable comprise only the success fee claimed by the child's or protected party's legal representative under a conditional fee agreement or the balance of any payment under a damages based agreement, the court may direct that-\n\n(a) the assessment procedure referred to in rule 46.10 and paragraph 6 of Practice Direction 46 shall not apply; and\n\n(b) such costs be assessed summarily.\n\n(This rule applies to a counterclaim by or on behalf of a child or protected party by virtue of rule 20.3.)\n\n---\n\nLitigants in person\n\n46.5\n\n(1) This rule applies where the court orders (whether by summary assessment or detailed assessment) that the costs of a litigant in person are to be paid by any other person.\n\n(2) The costs allowed under this rule will not exceed, except in the case of a disbursement, two-thirds of the amount which would have been allowed if the litigant in person had been represented by a legal representative.\n\n(3) The litigant in person shall be allowed -\n\n(a) costs for the same categories of -\n\n(i) work; and\n\n(ii) disbursements,\n\nwhich would have been allowed if the work had been done or the disbursements had been made by a legal representative on the litigant in person's behalf;\n\n(b) the payments reasonably made by the litigant in person for legal services relating to the conduct of the proceedings; and\n\n(c) the costs of obtaining expert assistance in assessing the costs claim.\n\n(4) The amount of costs to be allowed to the litigant in person for any item of work claimed will be -\n\n(a) where the litigant can prove financial loss, the amount that the litigant can prove to have been lost for time reasonably spent on doing the work; or\n\n(b) where the litigant cannot prove financial loss, an amount for the time reasonably spent on doing the work at the rate set out in Practice Direction 46.\n\n(5) A litigant who is allowed costs for attending at court to conduct the case is not entitled to a witness allowance in respect of such attendance in addition to those costs.\n\n(6) For the purposes of this rule, a litigant in person includes -\n\n(a) a company or other corporation which is acting without a legal representative; and\n\n(b) any of the following who acts in person (except where any such person is represented by a firm in which that person is a partner) -\n\n(i) a barrister;\n\n(ii) a solicitor;\n\n(iii) a solicitor's employee;\n\n(iv) a manager of a body recognised under section 9 of the Administration of Justice Act 19851;or\n\n(v) a person who, for the purposes of the 2007 Act 2,is an authorised person in relation to an activity which constitutes the conduct of litigation (within the meaning of that Act).\n\n---\n\nCosts where the court has made a group litigation order\n\n46.6\n\n(1) This rule applies where the court has made a Group Litigation Order ('GLO').\n\n(2) In this rule -\n\n'individual costs' means costs incurred in relation to an individual claim on the group register;\n\n'common costs' means -\n\n(i) costs incurred in relation to the GLO issues;\n\n(ii) individual costs incurred in a claim while it is proceeding as a test claim, and\n\n(iii) costs incurred by the lead legal representative in administering the group litigation; and\n\n'group litigant' means a claimant or defendant, as the case may be, whose claim is entered on the group register.\n\n(3) Unless the court orders otherwise, any order for common costs against group litigants imposes on each group litigant several liability for an equal proportion of those common costs.\n\n(4) The general rule is that a group litigant who is the paying party will, in addition to any liability to pay the receiving party, be liable for -\n\n(a)the individual costs of that group litigant's claim; and\n\n(b)an equal proportion, together with all the other group litigants, of the common costs.\n\n(5) Where the court makes an order about costs in relation to any application or hearing which involved -\n\n(a) one or more GLO issues; and\n\n(b) issues relevant only to individual claims,\n\nthe court will direct the proportion of the costs that is to relate to common costs and the proportion that is to relate to individual costs.\n\n(6) Where common costs have been incurred before a claim is entered on the group register, the court may order the group litigant to be liable for a proportion of those costs.\n\n(7) Where a claim is removed from the group register, the court may make an order for costs in that claim which includes a proportion of the common costs incurred up to the date on which the claim is removed from the group register.\n\n(Part 19 sets out rules about group litigation.)\n\n---\n\nOrders in respect of pro bono representation\n\n46.7\n\n(1) Where the court makes an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act -\n\n(a) the court may order the payment to the prescribed charity of a sum no greater than the costs specified in Part 45 to which the party with pro bono representation would have been entitled in accordance with that Part and in respect of that representation had it not been provided free of charge; and\n\n(b) where Part 45 does not apply, the court may assess the amount of the payment (other than a sum equivalent to fixed costs) to be made by the paying party to the prescribed charity by -\n\n(i) conducting a summary assessment; or\n\n(ii) making an order for and conducting a detailed assessment,\n\nof a sum equivalent to all or part of the costs the paying party would have been ordered to pay to the party with pro bono representation in respect of that representation had it not been provided free of charge.\n\n(2) Where the court makes an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act, the order must direct that the payment by the paying party be made to the prescribed charity.\n\n(3) The receiving party must send a copy of the order to the prescribed charity within 7 days of receipt of the order.\n\n(4) Where the court considers making or makes an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act, Parts 44 to 47 apply, where appropriate, with the following modifications -\n\n(a) references to 'costs orders', 'orders about costs' or 'orders for the payment of costs' are to be read, unless otherwise stated, as if they refer to an order under section 194(3);\n\n(b) references to 'costs' are to be read as if they referred to a sum equivalent to the costs that would have been claimed by, incurred by or awarded to the party with pro bono representation in respect of that representation had it not been provided free of charge; and\n\n(c) references to 'receiving party' are to be read, as meaning a party who has pro bono representation and who would have been entitled to be paid costs in respect of that representation had it not been provided free of charge.\n\n---\n\nII COSTS RELATING TO LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES\n\n---\n\nPersonal liability of legal representative for costs - wasted costs orders\n\n46.8\n\n(1) This rule applies where the court is considering whether to make an order under section 51(6) of the Senior Courts Act 19813(court's power to disallow or (as the case may be) order a legal representative to meet, 'wasted costs').\n\n(2) The court will give the legal representative a reasonable opportunity to make written submissions or, if the legal representative prefers, to attend a hearing before it makes such an order.\n\n(3) When the court makes a wasted costs order, it will -\n\n(a) specify the amount to be disallowed or paid; or\n\n(b) direct a costs judge or a district judge to decide the amount of costs to be disallowed or paid.\n\n(4) The court may direct that notice must be given to the legal representative's client, in such manner as the court may direct -\n\n(a) of any proceedings under this rule; or\n\n(b) of any order made under it against his legal representative.\n\n---\n\nBasis of detailed assessment of solicitor and client costs\n\n46.9\n\n(1) This rule applies to every assessment of a solicitor's bill to a client except a bill which is to be paid out of the Community Legal Service Fund under the Legal Aid Act 19884 or the Access to Justice Act 19995 or by the Lord Chancellor under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.\n\n(2) Section 74(3) of the Solicitors Act 19746 applies unless the solicitor and client have entered into a written agreement which expressly permits payment to the solicitor of an amount of costs greater than that which the client could have recovered from another party to the proceedings.\n\n(3) Subject to paragraph (2), costs are to be assessed on the indemnity basis but are to be presumed -\n\n(a) to have been reasonably incurred if they were incurred with the express or implied approval of the client;\n\n(b) to be reasonable in amount if their amount was expressly or impliedly approved by the client;\n\n(c) to have been unreasonably incurred if -\n\n(i) they are of an unusual nature or amount; and\n\n(ii) the solicitor did not tell the client that as a result the costs might not be recovered from the other party.\n\n(4) Where the court is considering a percentage increase on the application of the client, the court will have regard to all the relevant factors as they reasonably appeared to the solicitor or counsel when the conditional fee agreement was entered into or varied.\n\n---\n\nAssessment procedure\n\n46.10\n\n(1) This rule sets out the procedure to be followed where the court has made an order under Part III of the Solicitors Act 1974 for the assessment of costs payable to a solicitor by the solicitor's client.\n\n(2) The solicitor must serve a breakdown of costs within 28 days of the order for costs to be assessed.\n\n(3) The client must serve points of dispute within 14 days after service on the client of the breakdown of costs.\n\n(4) The solicitor must serve any reply within 14 days of service on the solicitor of the points of dispute.\n\n(5) Either party may file a request for a hearing date -\n\n(a) after points of dispute have been served; but\n\n(b) no later than 3 months after the date of the order for the costs to be assessed.\n\n(6) This procedure applies subject to any contrary order made by the court.\n\n---\n\nIII COSTS ON ALLOCATION AND RE-ALLOCATION\n\n46.11 Omitted\n\n46.12 Omitted\n\n---\n\nCosts following allocation, re-allocation and non-allocation\n\n46.13\n\n(1) Any costs orders made before a claim is allocated will not be affected by allocation.\n\n(2) Omitted\n\n(3) Where the court is assessing costs on the standard basis of a claim which concluded without being allocated to a track, it may restrict those costs to costs that would have been allowed on the track to which the claim would have been allocated if allocation had taken place.\n\nIV COSTS-ONLY PROCEEDINGS\n\n---\n\nCosts-only proceedings\n\n46.14\n\n(1) This rule applies where -\n\n(a) the parties to a dispute have reached an agreement on all issues (including which party is to pay the costs) which is made or confirmed in writing; but\n\n(b) they have failed to agree the amount of those costs; and\n\n(c) no proceedings have been started.\n\n(1 A) This rule does not apply to a dispute to which the procedure under section 10 of Practice Direction 27 B applies.\n\n(2) Where this rule applies, the procedure set out in this rule must be followed.\n\n(3) Proceedings under this rule are commenced by issuing a claim form in accordance with Part 8.\n\n(4) The claim form must contain or be accompanied by the agreement or confirmation.\n\n(5) In proceedings to which this rule applies the court may make an order for the payment of costs to be assessed and/or, where appropriate, may determine the fixed costs.\n\n(6) Where this rule applies but the procedure set out in this rule has not been followed by a party -\n\n(a) that party will not be allowed costs greater than those that would have been allowed to that party had the procedure been followed; and\n\n(b) the court may award the other party the costs of the proceedings up to the point where an order for the payment of costs is made.\n\n(7) Rule 44.5 (amount of costs where costs are payable pursuant to a contract) does not apply to claims started under the procedure in this rule.\n\n---\n\nV COSTS IN CLAIMS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW\n\n---\n\nClaims for judicial review: costs against interveners\n\n46.15\n\n(1) In this rule the terms \"intervener\" and \"relevant party\" have the same meaning as in section 87 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 (\"the 2015 Act\").\n\n(2) A relevant party may apply to the court for an order for an intervener to pay costs in accordance with section 87 of the 2015 Act.\n\n(Section 87 of the 2015 Act applies to judicial review proceedings in the High Court and Court of Appeal.)\n\n(Rule 54.17 makes provision for any person to be able to apply for permission to file evidence or make representations at the hearing of a judicial review.)\n\n---\n\nSECTION VI JUDICIAL REVIEW COSTS CAPPING ORDERS UNDER PART 4 OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND COURTS ACT 2015\n\n---\n\nJudicial review costs capping orders - general\n\n46.16\n\n(1) For the purposes of this Section-\n\n(a) \"judicial review costs capping order\" means a costs capping order made by the High Court or the Court of Appeal in accordance with sections 88, 89 and 90 of the 2015 Act; and\n\n(b) \"the 2015 Act\" means the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015.\n\n(2) This Section does not apply to a costs capping order under rule 3.19.\n\n(Rule 3.19 makes provision for orders limiting the amount of future costs (including disbursements) which a party may recover pursuant to an order for costs subsequently made.)\n\n---\n\nApplications for judicial review costs capping orders\n\n46.17\n\n(1) An application for a judicial review costs capping order must-\n\n(a) be made on notice and, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), in accordance with Part 23; and\n\n(b) be supported by evidence setting out-\n\n(i) why a judicial review costs capping order should be made, having regard, in particular, to the matters at sub-sections (6) to (8) of section 88 of the 2015 Act and sub-section (1) of section 89 of that Act;\n\n(ii) a summary of the applicant's financial resources;\n\n(iii) the costs (and disbursements) which the applicant considers the parties are likely to incur in the future conduct of the proceedings; and\n\n(iv) if the applicant is a body corporate, whether it is able to demonstrate that it is likely to have financial resources available to meet liabilities arising in connection with the proceedings.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraph (3), the applicant must serve a copy of the application notice and copies of the supporting documents on every other party.\n\n(3) On application by the applicant, the court may dispense with the need for the applicant to serve the evidence setting out a summary of the applicant's financial resources on one or more of the parties.\n\n(4) The court may direct the applicant to provide additional information or evidence to support its application.\n\n---\n\nCourt to consider making directions\n\n46.18 If the applicant is a body corporate, and the evidence supporting its application in accordance with rule 46.17(1)(b)(iv) sets out that it is unable to demonstrate that it is likely to have financial resources available to meet liabilities arising in connection with the proceedings, the court must consider giving directions for the provision of information about the applicant's members and their ability to provide financial support for the purposes of the proceedings.\n\n---\n\nApplications to vary judicial review costs capping orders\n\n46.19\n\n(1) An application to vary a judicial review costs capping order must be made on notice and, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), in accordance with Part 23.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraph (3), the applicant must serve a copy of the application notice and copies of any supporting documents on every other party.\n\n(3) If the application is supported by evidence setting out a summary of the applicant's financial resources, the court may, on application by the applicant, dispense with the need for the applicant to serve such evidence on one or more of the parties.\n\n---\n\nVII SCALE COSTS FOR CLAIMS IN THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ENTERPRISE COURT\n\n---\n\nScope and interpretation\n\n46.20\n\n(1) Subject to paragraph (2), this Section applies to proceedings in the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court.\n\n(2) This Section does not apply where-\n\n(a)the court considers that a party has behaved in a manner which amounts to an abuse of the court's process; or\n\n(b)the claim concerns the infringement or revocation of a patent or registered design or registered trade mark the validity of which has been certified by a court or by the Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks in earlier proceedings.\n\n(3) The court will make a summary assessment of the costs of the party in whose favour any order for costs is made. Rules 44.2(8), 44.7(b) and Part 47 do not apply to this Section.\n\n(4) 'Scale costs' means the costs set out in Table A and Table B of the Practice Direction supplementing this Part.\n\n---\n\nAmount of scale costs\n\n46.21\n\n(1) Subject to rule 46.22, the court will not order a party to pay total costs of more than-\n\n(a)£60,000 on the final determination of a claim in relation to liability; and\n\n(b)£30,000 on an inquiry as to damages or account of profits.\n\n(2) The amounts in paragraph (1) apply after the court has applied the provision on set off in accordance with rule 44.12(a).\n\n(3) The maximum amount of scale costs that the court will award for each stage of the claim is set out in Practice Direction 46.\n\n(4) The amount of the scale costs awarded by the court in accordance with paragraph (3) will depend on the nature and complexity of the claim.\n\n(5) Subject to assessment where appropriate, the following may be recovered in addition to the amount of the scale costs set out in Practice Direction 46 - Costs - Special Cases-\n\n(a)court fees;\n\n(b)costs relating to the enforcement of any court order; and\n\n(c)wasted costs.\n\n(6) Where appropriate, VAT may be recovered in addition to the amount of the scale costs and any reference in this Section to scale costs is a reference to those costs net of any such VAT.\n\n---\n\nSummary assessment of the costs of an application where a party has behaved unreasonably\n\n46.22\n\nCosts awarded to a party under rule 63.26(2) are in addition to the total costs that may be awarded to that party under rule 46.21.\n\nSECTION VIII - ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW COSTS\n\n---\n\nEnvironmental review costs\n\n46.23\n\n(1) In this Section, \"party\" includes an intervener or interested party.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraph (3), no party to a claim for environmental review (for which see Section III of Part 54) is entitled to an order for costs against any other party.\n\n(3) The court may make an order for costs against a party if satisfied that the conduct of a party or that party's legal representative, before or during the proceedings, was unreasonable or improper.\n\n(4) Where-\n\n(a)the court makes an order under paragraph (2) against a legally represented party; and\n\n(b)the party is not present when the order is made,\n\nthe party's legal representative must notify that party in writing of the order no later than 7 days after the legal representative receives notice of the order.\n\n---\n\nSECTION IX Costs Limits in Aarhus Convention Claims\n\n---\n\nScope and interpretation\n\n46.24\n\n(1) This section provides for the costs which are to be recoverable between the parties in Aarhus Convention claims.\n\n(2) In this Section-\n\n(a) \"Aarhus Convention claim\" means a claim brought by one or more members of the public by judicial review or review under statute which challenges the legality of any decision, act or omission of a body exercising public functions, and which is within the scope of Article 9(1), 9(2) or 9(3) of the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters done at Aarhus, Denmark on 25 June 1998 (\"the Aarhus Convention\");\n\n(b) references to a member or members of the public are to be construed in accordance with the Aarhus Convention.\n\n(3) This Section does not apply to appeals other than appeals brought under section 289(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990(1) or section 65(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990(2), which are for the purposes of this Section to be treated as reviews under statute.\n\n(Rule 52.19 A makes provision in relation to costs of an appeal.)\n\n(The Aarhus Convention is available on the UNECE website at https://www.unece.org/env/pp/welcome.html.)\n\n---\n\nOpting out, and other cases where rules 46.26 to 46.28 do not apply to a claimant\n\n46.25\n\n(1) Subject to paragraph (2), rules 46.26 to 46.28 apply where a claimant who is a member of the public has-\n\n(a) stated in the claim form that the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim; and\n\n(b) filed and served with the claim form a schedule of the claimant's financial resources, which is verified by a statement of truth and provides details of-\n\n(i) the claimant's significant assets, liabilities, income and expenditure; and\n\n(ii) in relation to any financial support which any person has provided or is likely to provide to the claimant, the aggregate amount which has been provided and which is likely to be provided.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraph (3), rules 46.26 to 46.28 do not apply where the claimant has stated in the claim form that although the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim, the claimant does not wish those rules to apply.\n\n(3) If there is more than one claimant, rules 46.26 to 46.28 do not apply in relation to the costs payable by or to any claimant who has not acted as set out in paragraph (1), or who has acted as set out in paragraph (2), or who is not a member of the public.\n\n---\n\nLimit on costs recoverable from a party in an Aarhus Convention claim\n\n46.26\n\n(1) Subject to rules 46.25 and 46.28, a claimant or defendant in an Aarhus Convention claim may not be ordered to pay costs exceeding the amounts in paragraph (2) or (3) or as varied in accordance with rule 46.27.\n\n(2) For a claimant the amount is-\n\n(a )£5,000 where the claimant is claiming only as an individual and not as, or on behalf of, a business or other legal person;\n\n(b) £10,000 in all other cases.\n\n(3) For a defendant the amount is £35,000.\n\n(4) In an Aarhus Convention claim with multiple claimants or multiple defendants, the amounts in paragraphs (2) and (3) (subject to any direction of the court under rule 46.27) apply in relation to each such claimant or defendant individually and may not be exceeded, irrespective of the number of receiving parties.\n\n---\n\nVarying the limit on costs recoverable from a party in an Aarhus Convention claim\n\n46.27\n\n(1) The court may vary the amounts in rule 46.26 or may remove altogether the limits on the maximum costs liability of any party in an Aarhus Convention claim.\n\n(2) The court may vary such an amount or remove such a limit only on an application made in accordance with paragraphs (5) to (7) (\"an application to vary\") and if satisfied that-\n\n(a) to do so would not make the costs of the proceedings prohibitively expensive for the claimant; and\n\n(b) in the case of a variation which would reduce a claimant's maximum costs liability or increase that of a defendant, without the variation the costs of the proceedings would be prohibitively expensive for the claimant.\n\n(3) Proceedings are to be considered prohibitively expensive for the purpose of this rule if their likely costs (including any court fees which are payable by the claimant) either-\n\n(a) exceed the financial resources of the claimant; or\n\n(b) are objectively unreasonable having regard to-\n\n(i) the situation of the parties;\n\n(ii) whether the claimant has a reasonable prospect of success;\n\n(iii) the importance of what is at stake for the claimant;\n\n(iv) the importance of what is at stake for the environment;\n\n(v) the complexity of the relevant law and procedure; and\n\n(vi) whether the claim is frivolous.\n\n(4) When the court considers the financial resources of the claimant for the purposes of this rule, it must have regard to any financial support which any person has provided or is likely to provide to the claimant.\n\n(5) Subject to paragraph (6), an application to vary must-\n\n(a) if made by the claimant, be made in the claim form and provide the claimant's reasons why, if the variation were not made, the costs of the proceedings would be prohibitively expensive for the claimant;\n\n(b) if made by the defendant, be made in the acknowledgment of service and provide the defendant's reasons why, if the variation were made, the costs of the proceedings would not be prohibitively expensive for the claimant; and\n\n(c) be determined by the court at the earliest opportunity.\n\n(6) An application to vary may be made at a later stage if there has been a significant change in circumstances (including evidence that the schedule of the claimant's financial resources contained false or misleading information) which means that the proceedings would now-\n\n(a) be prohibitively expensive for the claimant if the variation were not made; or\n\n(b) not be prohibitively expensive for the claimant if the variation were made.\n\n(7) An application under paragraph (6) must-\n\n(a) if made by the claimant-\n\n(i) be accompanied by a revised schedule of the claimant's financial resources or confirmation that the claimant's financial resources have not changed; and\n\n(ii) provide reasons why the proceedings would now be prohibitively expensive for the claimant if the variation were not made; and\n\n(b) if made by the defendant, provide reasons why the proceedings would now not be prohibitively expensive for the claimant if the variation were made.\n\n(Rule 39.2(3)(c) makes provision for a hearing (or any part of it) to be in private if it involves confidential information (including information relating to personal financial matters) and publicity would damage that confidentiality.)\n\n---\n\nChallenging whether the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim\n\n46.28\n\n(1) Where a claimant has complied with rule 46.25(1), and subject to rule 46.25(2) and (3), rule 46.26 applies unless-\n\n(a )the defendant has in the acknowledgment of service-\n\n(i) denied that the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim; and\n\n(ii) set out the defendant's grounds for such denial; and\n\n(b) the court has determined that the claim is not an Aarhus Convention claim.\n\n(2) Where the defendant denies that the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim, the court must determine that issue at the earliest opportunity.\n\n(3) In any proceedings to determine whether the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim-\n\n(a) if the court holds that the claim is not an Aarhus Convention claim, it shall, except for good reason, make no order for costs in relation to those proceedings;\n\n(b) if the court holds that the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim, it shall, except for good reason, order the defendant to pay the claimant's costs of those proceedings to be assessed on the standard basis, and that order may be enforced even if this would increase the costs payable by the defendant beyond the amount stated in rule 46.26(3) or any variation of that amount.\n\n---\n\nFootnotes\n\n• 1985 c. 61.

Whether costs were properly incurred depends on all the circumstances of the case including whether the trustee or personal representative ('the trustee') -\n\n(a) obtained directions from the court before bringing or defending the proceedings;\n\n(b) acted in the interests of the fund or estate or in substance for a benefit other than that of the estate, including the trustee's own; and\n\n(c) acted in some way unreasonably in bringing or defending, or in the conduct of, the proceedings.\n\n1.2 The trustee is not to be taken to have acted for a benefit other than that of the fund by reason only that the trustee has defended a claim in which relief is sought against the trustee personally.\n\n---\n\nCosts where money is payable by or to a child or protected party: rule 46.4\n\n2.1 The circumstances in which the court need not order the detailed assessment of costs under rule 46.4(2) are as follows -\n\n(a) where there is no need to do so to protect the interests of the child or protected party or their estate;\n\n(b) where another party has agreed to pay a specified sum in respect of the costs of the child or protected party and the legal representative acting for the child or protected party has waived the right to claim further costs;\n\n(c) where the court has decided the costs payable to the child or protected party by way of summary assessment and the legal representative acting for the child or protected party has waived the right to claim further costs;\n\n(d) where an insurer or other person is liable to discharge the costs which the child or protected party would otherwise be liable to pay to the legal representative and the court is satisfied that the insurer or other person is financially able to discharge those costs; and\n\n(e) where the court has given a direction for summary assessment pursuant to rule 46.4(5).\n\n---\n\nLitigants in person: rule 46.5\n\n3.1 In order to qualify as an expert for the purpose of rule 46.5(3)(c) (expert assistance in connection with assessing the claim for costs), the person in question must be a -\n\n(a) barrister;\n\n(b) solicitor;\n\n(c) Fellow of the Institute of Legal Executives;\n\n(d) Fellow of the Association of Costs Lawyers;\n\n(e) law costs draftsman who is a member of the Academy of Experts;\n\n(f) law costs draftsman who is a member of the Expert Witness Institute.\n\n3.2 Where a self represented litigant wishes to prove that the litigant has suffered financial loss, the litigant should produce to the court any written evidence relied on to support that claim, and serve a copy of that evidence on any party against whom the litigant seeks costs at least 24 hours before the hearing at which the question may be decided.\n\n3.3 A self represented litigant who commences detailed assessment proceedings under rule 47.5 should serve copies of that written evidence with the notice of commencement.\n\n3.4 The amount, which may be allowed to a self represented litigant under rule 46.5(4)(b), is £24 per hour.\n\n---\n\nOrders in respect of pro bono representation: rule 46.7\n\n4.1 Where an order is sought under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 2007 the party who has pro bono representation must prepare, file and serve a written statement of the sum equivalent to the costs that party would have claimed for that legal representation had it not been provided free of charge.\n\n---\n\nPersonal liability of legal representative for costs - wasted costs orders: rule 46.8\n\n5.1 A wasted costs order is an order -\n\n(a) that the legal representative pay a sum (either specified or to be assessed) in respect of costs to a party; or\n\n(b) for costs relating to a specified sum or items of work to be disallowed.\n\n5.2 Rule 46.8 deals with wasted costs orders against legal representatives. Such orders can be made at any stage in the proceedings up to and including the detailed assessment proceedings. In general, applications for wasted costs are best left until after the end of the trial.\n\n5.3 The court may make a wasted costs order against a legal representative on its own initiative.\n\n5.4 A party may apply for a wasted costs order -\n\n(a) by filing an application notice in accordance with Part 23; or\n\n(b) by making an application orally in the course of any hearing.\n\n5.5 It is appropriate for the court to make a wasted costs order against a legal representative, only if -\n\n(a) the legal representative has acted improperly, unreasonably or negligently;\n\n(b) the legal representative's conduct has caused a party to incur unnecessary costs, or has meant that costs incurred by a party prior to the improper, unreasonable or negligent act or omission have been wasted;\n\n(c) it is just in all the circumstances to order the legal representative to compensate that party for the whole or part of those costs.\n\n5.6 The court will give directions about the procedure to be followed in each case in order to ensure that the issues are dealt with in a way which is fair and as simple and summary as the circumstances permit.\n\n5.7 As a general rule the court will consider whether to make a wasted costs order in two stages -\n\n(a) at the first stage the court must be satisfied -\n\n(i) that it has before it evidence or other material which, if unanswered, would be likely to lead to a wasted costs order being made; and\n\n(ii) the wasted costs proceedings are justified notwithstanding the likely costs involved;\n\n(b) at the second stage, the court will consider, after giving the legal representative an opportunity to make representations in writing or at a hearing, whether it is appropriate to make a wasted costs order in accordance with paragraph 5.5 above.\n\n5.8 The court may proceed to the second stage described in paragraph 5.7 without first adjourning the hearing if it is satisfied that the legal representative has already had a reasonable opportunity to make representations.\n\n5.9 On an application for a wasted costs order under Part 23 the application notice and any evidence in support must identify -\n\n(a) what the legal representative is alleged to have done or failed to do; and\n\n(b) the costs that the legal representative may be ordered to pay or which are sought against the legal representative.\n\n---\n\nAssessment of solicitor and client costs: rules 46.9 and 46.10\n\n6.1 A client and solicitor may agree whatever terms they consider appropriate about the payment of the solicitor's charges. If however, the costs are of an unusual nature, either in amount or the type of costs incurred, those costs will be presumed to have been unreasonably incurred unless the solicitor satisfies the court that the client was informed that they were unusual and that they might not be allowed on an assessment of costs between the parties. That information must have been given to the client before the costs were incurred.\n\n6.2 Costs as between a solicitor and client are assessed on the indemnity basis. The presumptions in rule 46.9(3) are rebuttable.\n\n6.3 If a party fails to comply with the requirements of rule 46.10 concerning the service of a breakdown of costs or points of dispute, any other party may apply to the court in which the detailed assessment hearing should take place for an order requiring compliance. If the court makes such an order, it may -\n\n(a) make it subject to conditions including a condition to pay a sum of money into court; and\n\n(b) specify the consequence of failure to comply with the order or a condition.\n\n6.4 The procedure for obtaining an order under Part III of the Solicitors Act 1974 is by a Part 8 claim, as modified by rule 67.3 and Practice Direction 67. Precedent J of the Schedule of Costs Precedents is a model form of claim form. The application must be accompanied by the bill or bills in respect of which assessment is sought, and, if the claim concerns a conditional fee agreement, a copy of that agreement. If the original bill is not available a copy will suffice.\n\n6.5 Model forms of order, which the court may make, are set out in Precedents K, L and M of the Schedule of Costs Precedents.\n\n6.6 The breakdown of costs referred to in rule 46.10 is a document which contains the following information -\n\n(a) details of the work done under each of the bills sent for assessment; and\n\n(b) in applications under Section 70 of the Solicitors Act 1974, a cash account showing money received by the solicitor to the credit of the client and sums paid out of that money on behalf of the client but not payments out which were made in satisfaction of the bill or of any items which are claimed in the bill.\n\n6.7 Precedent P of the Schedule of Costs Precedents is a model form of breakdown of costs. A party who is required to serve a breakdown of costs must also serve -\n\n(a) copies of the fee notes of counsel and of any expert in respect of fees claimed in the breakdown, and\n\n(b) written evidence as to any other disbursement which is claimed in the breakdown and which exceeds £250.\n\n6.8 The provisions relating to default costs certificates (rule 47.11) do not apply to cases to which rule 46.10 applies.\n\n6.9 The time for requesting a detailed assessment hearing is within 3 months after the date of the order for the costs to be assessed.\n\n6.10 The form of request for a hearing date must be in Form N 258 C. The request must be accompanied by copies of -\n\n(a) the order sending the bill or bills for assessment;\n\n(b) the bill or bills sent for assessment;\n\n(c) the solicitor's breakdown of costs and any invoices or accounts served with that breakdown;\n\n(d) a copy of the points of dispute;\n\n(e) a copy of any replies served;\n\n(f) a statement signed by the party filing the request or that party's legal representative giving the names and addresses for service of all parties to the proceedings.\n\n6.11 The request must include the estimated length of hearing.\n\n6.12 On receipt of the request the court will fix a date for the hearing, or will give directions.\n\n6.13 The court will give at least 14 days notice of the time and place of the detailed assessment hearing.\n\n6.14 Unless the court gives permission, only the solicitor whose bill it is and parties who have served points of dispute may be heard and only items specified in the points of dispute may be raised.\n\n6.15 If a party wishes to vary that party's breakdown of costs, points of dispute or reply, an amended or supplementary document must be filed with the court and copies of it must be served on all other relevant parties. Permission is not required to vary a breakdown of costs, points of dispute or a reply but the court may disallow the variation or permit it only upon conditions, including conditions as to the payment of any costs caused or wasted by the variation.\n\n6.16 Unless the court directs otherwise the solicitor must file with the court the papers in support of the bill not less than 7 days before the date for the detailed assessment hearing and not more than 14 days before that date.\n\n6.17 Once the detailed assessment hearing has ended it is the responsibility of the legal representative appearing for the solicitor or, as the case may be, the solicitor in person to remove the papers filed in support of the bill.\n\n6.18 If, in the course of a detailed assessment hearing of a solicitor's bill to that solicitor's client, it appears to the court that in any event the solicitor will be liable in connection with that bill to pay money to the client, it may issue an interim certificate specifying an amount which in its opinion is payable by the solicitor to the client.\n\n6.19 After the detailed assessment hearing is concluded the court will -\n\n(a) complete the court copy of the bill so as to show the amount allowed;\n\n(b) determine the result of the cash account;\n\n(c) award the costs of the detailed assessment hearing in accordance with Section 70(8) of the Solicitors Act 1974; and\n\n(d) issue a final costs certificate.\n\n---\n\nCosts on the small claims and fast tracks: rule 46.11\n\n7.1\n\n(1) Omitted\n\n(2) Omitted\n\n(3) Where a claim, issued for a sum in excess of the normal financial scope of the small claims track, is allocated to that track only because an admission of part of the claim by the defendant reduces the amount in dispute to a sum within the normal scope of that track; on entering judgment for the admitted part before allocation of the balance of the claim the court may allow costs in respect of the proceedings down to that date.\n\n8 Omitted\n\n---\n\nCosts-only proceedings: rule 46.14\n\n9.1 A claim form under rule 46.14 should not be issued in the High Court unless the dispute to which the agreement relates was of such a value or type that proceedings would have been commenced in the High Court.\n\n9.2 A claim form which is to be issued in the High Court at the Royal Courts of Justice will be issued in the Costs Office.\n\n9.3 Attention is drawn to rule 8.2 (in particular to paragraph (b)(ii)) and to rule 46.14(3). The claim form must -\n\n(a) identify the claim or dispute to which the agreement relates;\n\n(b) state the date and terms of the agreement on which the claimant relies;\n\n(c) set out or attach a draft of the order which the claimant seeks;\n\n(d) state the amount of the costs claimed.\n\n9.4 Unless the court orders otherwise or Part 45 applies the costs will be treated as being claimed on the standard basis.\n\n9.5 The evidence required under rule 8.5 includes copies of the documents on which the claimant relies to prove the defendant's agreement to pay costs.\n\n9.6 A costs judge or a district judge has jurisdiction to hear and decide any issue which may arise in a claim issued under this rule irrespective of the amount of the costs claimed or of the value of the claim to which the agreement to pay costs relates. The court may make an order by consent under paragraph 9.8, or an order dismissing a claim under paragraph 9.10 below.\n\n9.7 When the time for filing the defendant's acknowledgement of service has expired, the claimant may request in writing that the court make an order in the terms of the claim, unless the defendant has filed an acknowledgement of service stating the intention to contest the claim or to seek a different order.\n\n9.8 Rule 40.6 applies where an order is to be made by consent. An order may be made by consent in terms which differ from those set out in the claim form.\n\n9.9 Where costs are ordered to be assessed, the general rule is that this should be by detailed assessment. However when an order is made under this rule following a hearing and the court is in a position to summarily assess costs it should generally do so.\n\n9.10 If the defendant opposes the claim the defendant must file a witness statement in accordance with rule 8.5(3). The court will then give directions including, if appropriate, a direction that the claim shall continue as if it were a Part 7 claim. A claim is not treated as opposed merely because the defendant disputes the amount of the claim for costs.\n\n9.11 A claim issued under this rule may be dealt with without being allocated to a track. Rule 8.9 does not apply to claims issued under this rule.\n\n9.12 Where there are other issues nothing in rule 46.14 prevents a person from issuing a claim form under Part 7 or Part 8 to sue on an agreement made in settlement of a dispute where that agreement makes provision for costs, nor from claiming in that case an order for costs or a specified sum in respect of costs but the 'costs only' procedure in rule 46.14 must be used where the sole issue is the amount of costs.\n\n---\n\nJudicial review costs capping orders under Part 4 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015: rules 46.16 to 46.19\n\n10.1 Unless the court directs otherwise, a summary of an applicant's financial resources under rule 46.17(1)(b)(ii) must provide details of-\n\n(a) the applicant's significant assets, liabilities, income and expenditure; and\n\n(b) in relation to any financial support which any person has provided or is likely to provide to the applicant, the aggregate amount-\n\n(i) which has been provided; and\n\n(ii) which is likely to be provided.\n\n10.2 An application to the High Court for a judicial review costs capping order must normally be contained in, or accompany, the claim form.\n\n---\n\nScale costs for proceedings in the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court - rule 46.20(4)\n\n11.1\n\n---\n\nTables A and B\n\n(a) Tables A and B set out the maximum amount of scale costs which the court will award for each stage of a claim in the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court;\n\n(b) Table A sets out the scale costs for each stage of a claim up to determination of liability; and\n\n(c) Table B sets out the scale costs for each stage of an inquiry as to damages or account of profits.\n\n---\n\nTable A\n\nStage of a claim\n\nMaximum amount of costs\n\nParticulars of claim\n\n£9,000\n\nDefence and counterclaim\n\n£8,000\n\nReply and defence to counterclaim\n\n£7,000\n\nReply to defence to counterclaim\n\n£3,500\n\nAttendance at a case management conference\n\n£6,000\n\nMaking or responding to an application\n\n£4,000\n\nProviding or inspecting disclosure or product/process description\n\n£6,000\n\nPerforming or inspecting experiments\n\n£3,000\n\nPreparing witness statements\n\n£8,000\n\nPreparing experts' report\n\n£9,000\n\nPreparing for and attending trial and judgment\n\n£20,000\n\nPreparing for determination on the papers\n\n£5,500\n\n---\n\nTable B\n\nStage of a claim\n\nMaximum amount of costs\n\nPoints of claim\n\n£4,000\n\nPoints of defence\n\n£4,000\n\nAttendance at a case management conference\n\n£5,000\n\nMaking or responding to an application\n\n£3,000\n\nProviding or inspecting disclosure\n\n£3,000\n\nPreparing witness statements\n\n£6,000\n\nPreparing experts' report\n\n£7,000\n\nPreparing for and attending trial and judgment\n\n£10,000\n\nPreparing for determination on the papers\n\n£3,000\".",

and\n\n(c) any party who has served points of dispute under rule 47.9,\n\nmay be heard at the detailed assessment hearing unless the court gives permission.\n\n(6) Only items specified in the points of dispute may be raised at the hearing, unless the court gives permission.\n\n(7) If an assessment is carried out at more than one hearing, then for the purposes of rule 52.12 time for appealing shall not start to run until the conclusion of the final hearing, unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(Practice Direction 47 specifies other documents which must be filed with the request for hearing and the length of notice which the court will give when it fixes a hearing date.)\n\n---\n\nProvisional Assessment\n\n47.15\n\n(1) This rule applies to any detailed assessment proceedings commenced in the High Court or the County Court on or after 1 April 2013 in which the costs claimed are the amount set out in paragraph 14.1 of the practice direction supplementing this Part, or less.\n\n(2) In proceedings to which this rule applies, the parties must comply with the procedure set out in Part 47 as modified by paragraph 14 Practice Direction 47.\n\n(3) The court will undertake a provisional assessment of the receiving party's costs on receipt of Form N 258 and the relevant supporting documents specified in Practice Direction 47.\n\n(4) The provisional assessment will be based on the information contained in the bill and supporting papers and the contentions set out in Precedent G (the points of dispute and any reply).\n\n(5) In proceedings which do not go beyond provisional assessment, the maximum amount the court will award to any party as costs of the assessment (other than the costs of drafting the bill of costs) is £1,500 together with any VAT thereon and any court fees paid by that party.\n\n(6) The court may at any time decide that the matter is unsuitable for a provisional assessment and may give directions for the matter to be listed for hearing. The matter will then proceed under rule 47.14 without modification.\n\n(7) When a provisional assessment has been carried out, the court will send a copy of the bill, as provisionally assessed, to each party with a notice stating that any party who wishes to challenge any aspect of the provisional assessment must, within 21 days of the receipt of the notice, file and serve on all other parties a written request for an oral hearing. If no such request is filed and served within that period, the provisional assessment shall be binding upon the parties, save in exceptional circumstances.\n\n(8) The written request referred to in paragraph (7) must -\n\n(a) identify the item or items in the court's provisional assessment which are sought to be reviewed at the hearing; and\n\n(b) provide a time estimate for the hearing.\n\n(9) The court then will fix a date for the hearing and give at least 14 days' notice of the time and place of the hearing to all parties.\n\n(10) Any party which has requested an oral hearing, will pay the costs of and incidental to that hearing unless -\n\n(a) it achieves an adjustment in its own favour by 20% or more of the sum provisionally assessed; or\n\n(b) the court otherwise orders.\n\n---\n\nV INTERIM COSTS CERTIFICATE AND FINAL COSTS CERTIFICATE\n\n---\n\nPower to issue an interim certificate\n\n47.16\n\n(1) The court may at any time after the receiving party has filed a request for a detailed assessment hearing -\n\n(a) issue an interim costs certificate for such sum as it considers appropriate; or\n\n(b) amend or cancel an interim certificate.\n\n(2) An interim certificate will include an order to pay the costs to which it relates, unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(3) The court may order the costs certified in an interim certificate to be paid into court.\n\n(4) Where the court -\n\n(a) issues an interim costs certificate; or\n\n(b) amends or cancels an interim certificate,\n\nin detailed assessment proceedings pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act, the receiving party must send a copy of the interim costs certificate or the order amending or cancelling the interim costs certificate to the prescribed charity.\n\n---\n\nFinal costs certificate\n\n47.17\n\n(1) In this rule a 'completed bill' means a bill calculated to show the amount due following the detailed assessment of the costs.\n\n(2) The period for filing the completed bill is 14 days after the end of the detailed assessment hearing.\n\n(3) When a completed bill is filed the court will issue a final costs certificate and serve it on the parties to the detailed assessment proceedings.\n\n(4) Paragraph (3) is subject to any order made by the court that a certificate is not to be issued until other costs have been paid.\n\n(5) A final costs certificate will include an order to pay the costs to which it relates, unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n(Practice Direction 47 deals with the form of a final costs certificate.)\n\n(6) Where the court issues a final costs certificate in detailed assessment proceedings pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act, the receiving party must send a copy of the final costs certificate to the prescribed charity.\n\n---\n\nVI DETAILED ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE FOR COSTS OF A LSC FUNDED CLIENT, AN ASSISTED PERSON OR PERSON TO WHOM LEGAL AID IS MADE AVAILABLE

Chancellor under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, that person's solicitor may commence detailed assessment proceedings by filing a request in the relevant practice form.\n\n(2) A request under paragraph (1) must be filed within 3 months after the date when the right to detailed assessment arose.\n\n(3) The solicitor must also serve a copy of the request for detailed assessment on the LSC funded client, the assisted person or the person to whom legal aid is provided, if notice of that person's interest has been given to the court in accordance with community legal service or legal aid regulations.\n\n(4) Where the solicitor has certified that the LSC funded client or that person wishes to attend an assessment hearing, the court will, on receipt of the request for assessment, fix a date for the assessment hearing.\n\n(5) Where paragraph (3) does not apply, the court will, on receipt of the request for assessment provisionally assess the costs without the attendance of the solicitor, unless it considers that a hearing is necessary.\n\n(6) After the court has provisionally assessed the bill, it will return the bill to the solicitor.\n\n(7) The court will fix a date for an assessment hearing if the solicitor informs the court, within 14 days after receiving the provisionally assessed bill, that the solicitor wants the court to hold such a hearing.\n\n---\n\nDetailed assessment procedure where costs are payable out of a fund other than the community legal service fund\n\n47.19\n\n(1) Where the court is to assess costs which are payable out of a fund other than the Community Legal Service Fund, the receiving party may commence detailed assessment proceedings by filing a request in the relevant practice form.\n\n(2) A request

court will fix a date for an assessment hearing if the receiving party informs the court, within 14 days after receiving the provisionally assessed bill, that the receiving party wants the court to hold such a hearing.\n\n---\n\nVII COSTS OF DETAILED ASSESSMENT PROCEEDINGS\n\n---\n\nLiability for costs of detailed assessment proceedings\n\n47.20\n\n(1) The receiving party is entitled to the costs of the detailed assessment proceedings except where -\n\n(a) the provisions of any Act, any of these Rules or any relevant practice direction provide otherwise; or\n\n(b) the court makes some other order in relation to all or part of the costs of the detailed assessment proceedings.\n\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply where the receiving party has pro bono representation in the detailed assessment proceedings but that party may apply for an order in respect of that representation under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act.\n\n(3) In deciding whether to make some other order, the court must have regard to all the circumstances, including -\n\n(a) the conduct of all the parties;\n\n(b) the amount, if any, by which the bill of costs has been reduced; and\n\n(c) whether it was reasonable for a party to claim the costs of a particular item or to dispute that item.\n\n(4) The provisions of Part 36 apply to the costs of detailed assessment proceedings with the following modifications -\n\n(a) 'claimant' refers to 'receiving party' and 'defendant' refers to 'paying party';\n\n(b) 'trial' refers to 'detailed assessment hearing';\n\n(c) a detailed assessment hearing is \"in progress\" from the time when it starts until the bill of costs has been assessed or agreed;\n\n(d) for rule 36.14(7) substitute \"If such sum is not paid within 14 days of acceptance of the offer, or such other period as has been agreed, the receiving party may apply for a final costs certificate for the unpaid sum.\";\n\n(e) a reference to 'judgment being entered' is to the completion of the detailed assessment, and references to a 'judgment' being advantageous or otherwise are to the outcome of the detailed assessment.\n\n(5) The court will usually summarily assess the costs of detailed assessment proceedings at the conclusion of those proceedings.\n\n(6) Unless the court otherwise orders, interest on the costs of detailed assessment proceedings will run from the date of default, interim or final costs certificate, as the case may be.\n\n(7) For the purposes of rule 36.17, detailed assessment proceedings are to be regarded as an independent claim.\n\n---\n\nVIII APPEALS FROM

    "content": "Document: Practice Direction 47 – Procedure for Detailed Assessment of Costs and Default Provisions\nPart 1 of 2\n==================================================\nPRACTICE DIRECTION 47 - PROCEDURE FOR DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF COSTS AND DEFAULT PROVISIONS\n\nContents of this Practice Direction Time when assessment may be carried out: rule 47.1\n\n1.1 For the purposes of rule 47.1, proceedings are concluded when the court has finally determined the matters in issue in the claim, whether or not there is an appeal, or made an award of provisional damages under Part 41.\n\n1.2 The court may order or the parties may agree in writing that, although the proceedings are continuing, they will nevertheless be treated as concluded.\n\n1.3 A party who is served with a notice of commencement (see paragraph 5.2 below) may apply to a costs judge or a District Judge to determine whether the party who served it is entitled to commence detailed assessment proceedings. On hearing such an application the orders which the court may make include: an order allowing the detailed assessment proceedings to continue, or an order setting aside the notice of commencement.\n\n1.4 A costs judge or a District Judge may make an order allowing detailed assessment proceedings to be commenced where there is no realistic prospect of the claim continuing. No stay of detailed assessment where there is an appeal: rule 47.2\n\n2 An application to stay the detailed assessment of costs pending an appeal may be made to the court whose order is being appealed or to the court which will hear the appeal. Powers of an authorised court officer: rule 47.3\n\n3.1 The court officers authorised by the Lord Chancellor to assess costs in the Costs Office and the Principal Registry of the Family Division are authorised to deal with claims where the base costs excluding VAT do not exceed £35,000 in the case of senior executive officers, or their equivalent, and £110,000 in the case of principal officers.\n\n3.2 Where the receiving party, paying party and any other party to the detailed assessment proceedings who has served points of dispute are agreed that the assessment should not be made by an authorised court officer, the receiving party should so inform the court when requesting a hearing date. The court will then list the hearing before a costs judge or a District Judge.\n\n3.3 In any other case a party who objects to the assessment being made by an authorised court officer must make an application to the costs judge or District Judge under Part 23 setting out the reasons for the objection. Venue for detailed assessment proceedings: rule 47.4\n\n4.1 For the purposes of rule 47.4(1) the 'appropriate office' means-\n\n(a) the district registry or County Court hearing centre in which the case was being dealt with when the judgment or order was made or the event occurred which gave rise to the right to assessment, or to which it has subsequently been transferred;\n\n(b) where a tribunal, person or other body makes an order for the detailed assessment of costs, a County Court hearing centre (subject to paragraph 4.2); or\n\n(c) in all other cases, including Court of Appeal cases, the Costs Office.\n\n4.2\n\n(1) This paragraph applies where the appropriate office is any of the following County Court hearing centres: Barnet, Brentford, Bromley, Central London, Clerkenwell and Shoreditch, Croydon, Edmonton, Ilford, Kingston, Mayors and City of London, Romford, Uxbridge, Wandsworth and Willesden.\n\n(2) Where this paragraph applies-\n\n(a) the receiving party must file any request for a detailed assessment hearing in the Costs Office and, for all purposes relating to that detailed assessment (other than the issue of default costs certificates and applications to set aside default costs certificates), the Costs Office will be treated as the appropriate office in that case;\n\n(b) default costs certificates should be issued and applications to set aside default costs certificates should be issued and heard in the relevant County Court hearing centre; and\n\n(c) unless an order is made under rule 47.4(2) directing that the Costs Office as part of the High Court shall be the appropriate office, an appeal from any decision made by a costs judge shall lie to the Designated Civil Judge for the London Group of County Court hearing centres or such judge as the Designated Civil Judge shall nominate. The appeal notice and any other relevant papers should be lodged at the Central London Civil Justice Centre.\n\n4.3\n\n(1) A direction under rule 47.4(2) or (3) specifying a particular court, registry or office as the appropriate office may be given on application or on the court's own initiative.\n\n(2) Unless the Costs Office is the appropriate office for the purposes of rule 47.4(1) an order directing that an assessment is to take place at the Costs Office will be made only if it is appropriate to do so having regard to the size of the bill of costs, the difficulty of the issues involved, the likely length of the hearing, the cost to the parties and any other relevant matter. Commencement of detailed assessment proceedings: rule 47.6\n\n5.1 In the circumstances provided for in this paragraph, bills of costs for detailed assessment must be in electronic spreadsheet format and compliant with paragraphs 5.A 1 to 5.A 4 (\"electronic bills\") while in all other circumstances bills of costs may be electronic bills or may be on paper (\"paper bills\") and compliant with paragraphs 5.7 to 5.21. Precedents A, B, C and D in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction are model forms of paper bills of costs for detailed assessment. The circumstances in which bills of costs must be electronic bills are that-\n\n(a) the case is a Part 7 multi-track claim, except-\n\n(i) for cases in which the proceedings are subject to fixed costs or scale costs;\n\n(ii) cases in which the receiving party is unrepresented; or\n\n(iii) where the court has otherwise ordered; and\n\n(b) the bills of costs relate to costs recoverable between the parties for work undertaken after 6 April 2018 (\"the Transition Date\").\n\n5.A 1 A model electronic bill is annexed to this version of this Practice Direction as Precedent S. The online version of this Practice Direction at\n\nhttp://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-47-procedure-for-detailed-assessment/practice-direction-46-costs-special-cases 2\n\nannexes Precedent S in spreadsheet and pdf formats.\n\n5.A 2 Electronic bills may be in either Precedent S spreadsheet format online athttp://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civilor any other spreadsheet format which-\n\n(a) reports and aggregates costs based on the phases, tasks, activities and expenses defined in Schedule 2 to this Practice Direction;\n\n(b) reports summary totals in a form comparable to Precedent S;\n\n(c) allows the user to identify, in chronological order, the detail of all the work undertaken in each phase;\n\n(d) automatically recalculates intermediate and overall summary totals if input data is changed;\n\n(e) contains all calculations and reference formulae in a transparent manner so as to make its full functionality available to the court and all other parties.\n\n5.A 3 The provisions of paragraphs 5.7 to 5.21 of this Practice Direction shall apply to electronic bills insofar as they are not inconsistent with the form and content of Precedent S. Where those paragraphs require or recommend division of the bill into parts, electronic bills (unless the format of the bill already provides the requisite information, for example in identifying the costs within each phase) should incorporate a summary in a form comparable to the \"Funding and Parts Table\" in Precedent S to provide the information that would otherwise be provided by its division into parts.\n\n5.A 4 Where a bill of costs otherwise falls within paragraph 5.1(a) but work was done both before and after the Transition Date, a party may serve and file either a paper bill or an electronic bill in respect of work done before that date and must serve and file an electronic bill in respect of work done after that date.\".\n\n5.1 ASubject to paragraph 5.1 B, whenever electronic bills are served or filed at the court-\n\n(a) they must be served or filed in hard copy, in a manageable paper format as shown in the pdf version of Precedent S; and\n\n(b) a copy of the full electronic spreadsheet version must at the same time be provided to the paying party, or as appropriate filed at court, by e-mail or other electronic means.\n\n5.1 BWhenever an electronic bill is filed at the Costs Office using Electronic Working (see Practice Direction 51 O)-\n\n(a) a copy of the full electronic spreadsheet version and a pdf version must be uploaded; and\n\n(b) the electronic bill must not be filed at court by any other means.\n\n5.2 On commencing detailed assessment proceedings, the receiving party must serve on the paying party and all the other relevant persons the following documents -\n\n(a) a notice of commencement in Form N 252;\n\n(b) a copy (or, where paragraph 5.A 4 applies, copies) of the bill of costs;\n\n(c) copies of the fee notes of counsel and of any expert in respect of fees claimed in the bill;\n\n(d) written evidence as to any other disbursement which is claimed and which exceeds £500;\n\n(e) a statement giving the name and address for service of any person upon whom the receiving party intends to serve the notice of commencement;\n\n(f) if a costs management order has been made (and if the same information is not already fully provided in an electronic bill), a breakdown of the costs claimed for each phase of the proceedings. Precedent Q in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction is a model form of breakdown of the costs claimed for each phase of the proceedings.\n\n5.3 The notice of commencement must be completed to show as separate items-\n\n(a) the total amount of the costs claimed in the bill;\n\n(b) the extra sum which will be payable by way of fixed costs and court fees if a default costs certificate is obtained.\n\n5.4 Where the notice of commencement is to be served outside England and Wales the date to be inserted in the notice of commencement for the paying party to send points of dispute is a date (not less than 21 days from the date of service of the notice) which must be calculated by reference to Section IV of Part 6 as if the notice were a claim form and as if the date to be inserted was the date for the filing of a defence.\n\n5.5\n\n(1) For the purposes of rule 47.6(2) a 'relevant person' means-\n\n(a) any person who has taken part in the proceedings which gave rise to the assessment and who is directly liable under an order for costs made against that person;\n\n(b) any person who has given to the receiving party notice in writing that that person has a financial interest in the outcome of the assessment and wishes to be a party accordingly;\n\n(c) any other person whom the court orders to be treated as such.\n\n(2) Where a party is unsure whether a person is or is not a relevant person, that party may apply to the appropriate office for directions.\n\n(3) The court will generally not make an order that the person in respect of whom the application is made will be treated as a relevant person, unless within a specified time that person applies to the court to be joined as a party to the assessment proceedings in accordance with Part 19 (Parties and Group Litigation).\n\n5.6 Where-\n\n(a) a paper bill is capable of being copied electronically; and\n\n(b) before the detailed assessment hearing,\n\na paying party requests an electronic copy of the bill, the receiving party must supply the paying party with a copy in its native format (for example, in Excel or an equivalent) free of charge not more than 7 days after receipt of the request. Form and contents of bills of costs - general\n\n5.7 A bill of costs may consist of such of the following sections as may be appropriate-\n\n(1) title page;\n\n(2) background information;\n\n(3) items of costs claimed under the headings specified in paragraph 5.12;\n\n(4) summary showing the total costs claimed on each page of the bill;\n\n(5) schedules of time spent on non-routine attendances; and\n\n(6) the certificates referred to in paragraph 5.21.\n\nIf the only dispute between the parties concerns disbursements, the bill of costs shall be limited to items (1) and (2) above, a list of the disbursements in issue and brief written submissions in respect of those disbursements.\n\n5.8 Where it is necessary or convenient to do so, a bill of costs may be divided into two or more parts, each part containing sections (2), (3) and (4) above. Circumstances in which it will be necessary or convenient to divide a bill into parts include the following-\n\n(1) Where the receiving party acted in person during the course of the proceedings (whether or not that party also had a legal representative at that time) the bill must be divided into different parts so as to distinguish between;\n\n(a) the costs claimed for work done by the legal representative; and\n\n(b) the costs claimed for work done by the receiving party in person.\n\n(2) Where the receiving party had pro bono representation for part of the proceedings and an order under section 194(3) of the Legal Services Act 2007 has been made, the bill must be divided into different parts so as to distinguish between-\n\n(a) the sum equivalent to the costs claimed for work done by the legal representative acting free of charge; and\n\n(b) the costs claimed for work not done by the legal representative acting free of charge.\n\n(3) Where the receiving party was represented by different legal representatives during the course of the proceedings, the bill must be divided into different parts so as to distinguish between the costs payable in respect of each legal representative.\n\n(4) Where the receiving party obtained legal aid or LSC funding or is a person for whom civil legal services (within the meaning of Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012) were provided under arrangements made for the purposes of that Part of that Act in respect of all or part of the proceedings, the bill must be divided into separate parts so as to distinguish between-\n\n(a) costs claimed before legal aid or LSC funding was granted or before civil legal services were provided;\n\n(b) costs claimed after legal aid or LSC funding was granted or after civil legal services were provided; and\n\n(c) any costs claimed after legal aid or LSC funding ceased or after civil legal services ceased to be provided.\n\n(5) Where the bill covers costs payable under an order or orders under which there are different paying parties the bill must be divided into parts so as to deal separately with the costs payable by each paying party.\n\n(6) Where the bill covers costs payable under an order or orders, in respect of which the receiving party wishes to claim interest from different dates, the bill must be divided to enable such interest to be calculated.\n\n(7) Where the case commenced on or after 1 April 2013, the bill covers costs for work done both before and after that date and the costs are to be assessed on the standard basis, the bill must be divided into parts so as to distinguish between costs shown as incurred for work done before 1 April 2013 and costs shown as incurred for work done on or after 1 April 2013.(8) Where a costs management order has been made, the costs are to be assessed on the standard basis and the receiving party's budget has been agreed by the paying party or approved by the court, the bill must be divided into separate parts so as to distinguish between the costs claimed for each phase of the last approved or agreed budget, and within each such part the bill must distinguish between the costs shown as incurred in the last agreed or approved budget and the costs shown as estimated.(9) Where a costs management order has been made and the receiving party's budget has been agreed by the paying party or approved by the court, (a) the costs of initially completing Precedent H and (b) the other costs of the budgeting and costs management process must be set out in separate parts.\n\n5.9 Where a party claims costs against another party and also claims costs against the LSC or Lord Chancellor only for work done in the same period, the costs claimed against the LSC or Lord Chancellor only can be claimed either in a separate part of the bill or in additional columns in the same part of the bill. Precedents B and C in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction show how bills should be drafted when costs are claimed against the LSC only.

Form and content of bills of costs: heads of costs\n\n5.12 The bill of costs may consist of items under such of the following heads as may be appropriate-\n\n(1) attendances at court and upon counsel up to the date of the notice of commencement;\n\n(2) attendances on and communications with the receiving party;\n\n(3) attendances on and communications with witnesses including any expert witness;\n\n(4) attendances to inspect any property or place for the purposes of the proceedings;\n\n(5) attendances on and communications with other persons, including offices of public records;\n\n(6) communications with the court and with counsel;\n\n(7) work done on documents:\n\n(8) work done in connection with negotiations with a view to settlement if not already covered in the heads listed above;\n\n(9) attendances on and communications with London and other agents and work done by them;\n\n(10) other work done which was of or incidental to the proceedings and which is not already covered in the heads listed above.\n\n5.13 In respect of each of the heads of costs-\n\n(1) 'communications' means letters out e-mails out and telephone calls;\n\n(2) communications, which are not routine communications, must be set out in chronological order;\n\n(3) routine communications must be set out as a single item at the end of each head;\n\n5.14 Routine communications are letters out, e-mails out and telephone calls which because of their simplicity should not be regarded as letters or e-mails of substance or telephone calls which properly amount to an attendance.\n\n5.15 Each item claimed in the bill of costs must be consecutively numbered.\n\n5.16 In each part of the bill of costs which claims items under head (1) in paragraph 5.12 (attendances at court and upon counsel) a note should be made of-\n\n(1) all relevant events, including events which do not constitute chargeable items;\n\n(2) any orders for costs which the court made (whether or not a claim is made in respect of those costs in this bill of costs).\n\n5.17 The numbered items of costs may be set out on paper divided into columns.

If the bill of costs contains more than one schedule each schedule should be numbered consecutively.\n\n5.19 The bill of costs must not contain any claims in respect of costs or court fees which relate solely to the detailed assessment proceedings other than costs claimed for preparing and checking the bill.\n\n5.20 The summary must show the total profit costs and disbursements claimed separately from the total VAT claimed. Where the bill of costs is divided into parts the summary must also give totals for each part. If each page of the bill gives a page total the summary must also set out the page totals for each page.\n\n5.21 The bill of costs must contain such of the certificates, the texts of which are set out in Precedent F of the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction, as are appropriate.\n\n5.22 The following provisions relate to work done by legal representatives -\n\n(1) Routine letters out, routine e-mails out and routine telephone calls will in general be allowed on a unit basis of 6 minutes each, the charge being calculated by reference to the appropriate hourly rate. The unit charge for letters out and e-mails out will include perusing and considering the routine letters in or e-mails in.\n\n(2) The court may, in its discretion, allow an actual time charge for preparation of electronic communications sent by legal representatives, which properly amount to attendances provided that the time taken has been recorded.\n\n(3) Local travelling expenses incurred by legal representatives will not be allowed. The definition of 'local' is a matter for the discretion of the court. As a matter of guidance, 'local' will, in general, be taken to mean within a radius of 10 miles from the court dealing with the case at the relevant time. Where travelling and waiting time is claimed, this should be allowed at the rate agreed with the client unless this is more than the hourly rate on the assessment.\n\n(4) The cost of postage, couriers, out-going telephone calls, fax and telex messages will in general not be allowed but the court may exceptionally in its discretion allow such expenses in unusual circumstances or where the cost is unusually heavy.\n\n(5) The cost of making copies of documents will not in general be allowed but the court may exceptionally in its discretion make an allowance for copying in unusual circumstances or where the documents copied are unusually numerous in relation to the nature of the case. Where this discretion is invoked the number of copies made, their purpose and the costs claimed for them must be set out in the bill.\n\n(6) Agency charges as between principal legal representatives and their agents will be dealt with on the principle that such charges, where appropriate, form part of the principal legal representative's charges. Where these charges relate to head (1) in paragraph 5.12 (attendances at court and on counsel) they must be included in their chronological order in that head. In other cases they must be included in head (9) (attendances on London and other agents).

Points of dispute and consequences of not serving: rule 47.9\n\n8.1 Time for service of points of dispute may be extended or shortened either by agreement (rule 2.11) or by the court (rule 3.1(2)(a)). Any application is to the appropriate office.\n\n8.2 Points of dispute must be short and to the point.They must follow Precedent G in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction, so far as practicable.They must:\n\n(a) identify any general points or matters of principle which require decision before the individual items in the bill are addressed; and\n\n(b) identify specific points, stating concisely the nature and grounds of dispute.\n\nOnce a point has been made it should not be repeated but the item numbers where the point arises should be inserted in the left hand box as shown in Precedent G.",

    "content": "Document: Practice Direction 47 – Procedure for Detailed Assessment of Costs and Default Provisions\nPart 2 of 2\n==================================================\n8.3 The paying party must state in an open letter accompanying the points of dispute what sum, if any, that party offers to pay in settlement of the total costs claimed.The paying party may also make an offer under Part 36. Procedure where costs are agreed and on discontinuance: rule 47.10\n\n9.1 Where the parties have agreed terms as to the issue of a costs certificate (either interim or final) they should apply under rule 40.6 (Consent judgments and orders) for an order that a certificate be issued in the terms set out in the application. Such an application may be dealt with by a court officer, who may issue the certificate.\n\n9.2 Where in the course of proceedings the receiving party claims that the paying party has agreed to pay costs but that the paying party will neither pay those costs nor join in a consent application under paragraph 9.1, the receiving party may apply under Part 23 for a certificate either interim or final to be issued.\n\n9.3 Nothing in rule 47.10 prevents parties who seek a judgment or order by consent from including in the draft a term that a party shall pay to another party a specified sum in respect of costs.\n\n9.4\n\n(1) The receiving party may discontinue the detailed assessment proceedings in accordance with Part 38 (Discontinuance).\n\n(2) Where the receiving party discontinues the detailed assessment proceedings before a detailed assessment hearing has been requested, the paying party may apply to the appropriate office for an order about the costs of the detailed assessment proceedings.\n\n(3) Where a detailed assessment hearing has been requested the receiving party may not discontinue unless the court gives permission.\n\n(4) A bill of costs may be withdrawn by consent whether or not a detailed assessment hearing has been requested. Default costs certificate: rule 47.11\n\n10.1\n\n(1) A request for the issue of a default costs certificate must be made in Form N 254 and must be signed by the receiving party or his legal representative.\n\n(2) The request must be accompanied by a copy of the document giving the right to detailed assessment and must be filed at the appropriate office. (Paragraph 13.3 below identifies the appropriate documents).\n\n10.2 A default costs certificate will be in Form N 255.\n\n10.3 Attention is drawn to Rules 40.3 (Drawing up and Filing of Judgments and Orders) and 40.4 (Service of Judgments and Orders) which apply to the preparation and service of a default costs certificate. The receiving party will be treated as having permission to draw up a default costs certificate by virtue of this Practice Direction.\n\n10.4 The issue of a default costs certificate does not prohibit, govern or affect any detailed assessment of the same costs which are payable out of the Community Legal Service Fund or by the Lord Chancellor under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.\n\n10.5 An application for an order staying enforcement of a default costs certificate may be made either-\n\n(a) to a costs judge or District Judge of the court office which issued the certificate; or\n\n(b) to the court (if different) which has general jurisdiction to enforce the certificate.\n\n10.6 Proceedings for enforcement of default costs certificates may not be issued in the Costs Office. Default costs certificate: fixed costs on the issue of a default costs certificate\n\n10.7 Unless paragraph 1.2 of Practice Direction 45 (Fixed Costs in Small Claims) applies or unless the court orders otherwise, the fixed costs to be included in a default costs certificate are £80 plus a sum equal to any appropriate court fee payable on the issue of the certificate.\n\n10.8 The fixed costs included in a certificate must not exceed the maximum sum specified for costs and court fee in the notice of commencement. Setting aside default costs certificate: rule 47.12\n\n11.1 A court officer may set aside a default costs certificate at the request of the receiving party under rule 47.12.A costs judge or a District Judge will make any other order or give any directions under this rule.\n\n11.2\n\n(1) An application for an order under rule 47.12(2) to set aside or vary a default costs certificate must be supported by evidence.\n\n(2) In deciding whether to set aside or vary a certificate under rule 47.12(2) the matters to which the court must have regard include whether the party seeking the order made the application promptly.\n\n(3) As a general rule a default costs certificate will be set aside under rule 47.12 only if the applicant shows a good reason for the court to do so and if the applicant files with the application a copy of the bill, a copy of the default costs certificate and a draft of the points of dispute the applicant proposes to serve if the application is granted.\n\n11.3 Attention is drawn to rule 3.1(3) (which enables the court when making an order to make it subject to conditions) and to rule 44.2(8) (which enables the court to order a party whom it has ordered to pay costs to pay an amount on account before the costs are assessed). A costs judge or a District Judge may exercise the power of the court to make an order under rule 44.2(8) although he did not make the order about costs which led to the issue of the default costs certificate. Optional reply: rule 47.13\n\n12.1 A reply served by the receiving party under Rule 47.13 must be limited to points of principle and concessions only. It must not contain general denials, specific denials or standard form responses.\n\n12.2 Whenever practicable, the reply must be set out in the form of Precedent G.

information provided by the legal representative to the client explaining how the legal representative's charges are to be calculated;\n\n(j) a statement signed by the receiving party or the legal representative giving the name, email address, address for service, reference and telephone number and fax number, if any, of-\n\n(i) the receiving party;\n\n(ii) the paying party;\n\n(iii) any other person who has served points of dispute or who has given notice to the receiving party under paragraph 5.5(1)(b) above;\n\nand giving an estimate of the length of time the detailed assessment hearing

of costs;\n\n(m) if a costs management order has been made, a breakdown of the costs claimed for each phase of the proceedings.\n\n13.3'The document giving the right to detailed assessment' means such one or more of the following documents as are appropriate to the detailed assessment proceedings-\n\n(a) a copy of the judgment or order of the court or tribunal giving the right to detailed assessment;\n\n(b) a copy of the notice sent by the court under Practice Direction 3 B paragraph 1, being notification that a claim has been struck out under rule 3.7 or rule 3.7 A 1 for non-payment

copy of the order, award or determination of a statutorily constituted tribunal or body.\n\n13.4 On receipt of the request for a detailed assessment hearing the court will fix a date for the hearing, or, if the costs officer so decides, will give directions or fix a date for a preliminary appointment.\n\n13.5 Unless the court otherwise orders, if the only dispute between the parties concerns disbursements, the hearing shall take place in the absence of the parties on the basis of the documents and the court will issue its decision in writing.\n\n13.6 The court will give at least 14 days' notice of the time and place of the detailed assessment hearing to every person named in the statement referred to in paragraph 13.2(j) above.\n\n13.7 If either party wishes to make an application in the detailed assessment proceedings the provisions of Part 23 apply.\n\n13.8\n\n(1) This paragraph deals with the procedure to be adopted where a date has been given by the court for a detailed assessment hearing and-\n\n(a) the detailed assessment proceedings are settled; or\n\n(b) a party to the detailed assessment proceedings wishes to apply to vary the date which the court has fixed; or\n\n(c) the parties to the detailed assessment proceedings agree about changes they wish to make to any direction given for the management of the detailed assessment proceedings.\n\n(2) If detailed

accordance with Part 23.\n\n(4) If the parties agree about changes they wish to make to any direction given for the management of the detailed assessment proceedings-\n\n(a) they must apply to the court for an order by consent; and\n\n(b) they must file a draft of the directions sought and an agreed statement of the reasons why the variation is sought; and\n\n(c) the court may make an order in

Power to issue an interim certificate: rule 47.16\n\n15 A party wishing to apply for an interim certificate may do so by making an application in accordance with Part 23. Final costs certificate: rule 47.17\n\n16.1 At the detailed assessment hearing the court will indicate any disallowance or reduction in the sums claimed in the bill of costs by making an appropriate note on the bill.\n\n16.2 The receiving party must, in order to complete the bill after the detailed assessment hearing make clear the correct figures agreed or allowed in respect of each item and must re-calculate the summary of the bill appropriately.\n\n16.3 The completed bill of costs must be filed with the court no later than 14 days after the detailed assessment hearing.\n\n16.4 At the same time as filing the completed bill of costs, the party whose bill it is must also produce receipted fee notes and receipted accounts in respect of all disbursements except those covered by a certificate in Precedent F(5) in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction.\n\n16.5 No final costs certificate will be issued until all relevant court fees payable on the assessment of costs have been paid.\n\n16.6 If the receiving party fails to file a completed bill in accordance with rule 47.17 the paying party may make an application under Part 23 seeking an appropriate order under rule 3.1.\n\n16.7 A final costs certificate will show-\n\n(a) the amount of any costs which have been agreed between the parties or which have been allowed on detailed assessment;\n\n(b) where applicable the amount agreed or allowed in respect of VAT on such costs.\n\nThis provision is subject to any contrary statutory provision relating to costs payable out of the Community Legal Service Fund or by the Lord Chancellor under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.\n\n16.8 A final costs certificate will include disbursements in respect of the fees of counsel only if receipted fee notes or accounts in respect of those disbursements have been produced to the court and only to the extent indicated by those receipts.\n\n16.9 Where the certificate relates to costs payable between parties a separate certificate will be issued for each party entitled to costs.\n\n16.10 Form N 257 is a model form of interim costs certificate and Form N 256 is a model form of final costs certificate.\n\n16.11 An application for an order staying enforcement of an interim costs certificate or final costs certificate may be made either-\n\n(a) to a costs judge or District Judge of the court office which issued the certificate; or\n\n(b) to the court (if different) which has general jurisdiction to enforce the certificate.\n\n16.12 An interim or final costs certificate may be enforced as if it were a judgment for the payment of an amount of money.However, proceedings for the enforcement of interim costs certificates or final costs certificates may not be issued in the Costs Office. Detailed assessment procedure where costs are payable out of the Community Legal Service fund or by the Lord Chancellor under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012: rule 47.18\n\n17.1 The time for requesting a detailed assessment under rule 47.18 is within 3 months after the date when the right to detailed assessment arose.\n\n17.2\n\n(1) The request for a detailed assessment of costs must be in Form N 258 A. The request must be accompanied by-\n\n(a) a copy of the bill of costs;\n\n(b) the document giving the right to detailed assessment (see paragraph 13.3 above);\n\n(c) copies of all orders made by the court relating to the costs which are to be assessed;\n\n(d) copies of any fee notes of counsel and any expert in respect of fees claimed in the bill;\n\n(e) written evidence as to any other disbursement which is claimed and which exceeds £500;\n\n(f) the legal aid certificates, LSC certificates, certificates recording the determinations of the Director of Legal Aid Casework, any relevant amendment certificates, any authorities and any certificates of discharge, revocation or withdrawal; and\n\n(g) a statement signed by the legal representative giving the representative's name, address for service, reference, telephone number, e-mail address and, if the assisted person has a financial interest in the detailed assessment and wishes to attend, giving the postal address of that person, to which the court will send notice of any hearing.\n\n(2) The relevant papers in support of the bill as described in paragraph 13.12 must only be lodged if requested by the costs officer.\n\n17.3 Where the court has provisionally assessed a bill of costs it will send to the legal representative a notice, in Form N 253 annexed to this practice direction, of the amount of costs which the court proposes to allow together with the bill itself. The legal representative should, if the provisional assessment is to be accepted, then complete the bill.\n\n17.4 If the solicitor whose bill it is, or any other party wishes to make an application in the detailed assessment proceedings, the provisions of Part 23 applies.\n\n17.5 It is the responsibility of the legal representative to complete the bill by entering in the bill the correct figures allowed in respect of each item, recalculating the summary of the bill appropriately and completing the Community Legal Service assessment certificate (Form EX 80 A). Costs payable by the legal services commission or Lord Chancellor at prescribed rates\n\n17.6 Where the costs of an assisted person or LSC funded client or person to whom civil legal services (within the meaning of Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012) are provided under arrangements made for the purposes of that Part of that Act are payable by another person but costs can be claimed against the LSC or Lord Chancellor at prescribed rates (with or without enhancement), the solicitor of the assisted person or LSC funded client or person to whom civil legal services are provided must file a legal aid/ LSC schedule in accordance with paragraph 13.2(l) above.If on paper (a \"paper schedule\") the schedule should follow as closely as possible Precedent E of the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to this Practice Direction. If an electronic bill of costs is served on the other person an electronic schedule may, subject to paragraphs 17.7 and 17.8 below, be prepared and filed as if it were an electronic bill.\n\n17.7 The schedule must set out by reference to the item numbers in the bill of costs, all the costs claimed as payable by another person, but the arithmetic in the schedule should claim those items at prescribed rates only (with or without any claim for enhancement).\n\n17.8 Where there has been a change in the prescribed rates during the period covered by the bill of costs, a paper schedule (as opposed to the bill) should be divided into separate parts, so as to deal separately with each change of rate. The paper schedule must also be divided so as to correspond with any divisions in the bill of costs. If the schedule is an electronic schedule, unless the format of the schedule already provides the requisite information it should incorporate a summary in a form comparable to the \"Funding and Parts Table\" in Precedent S to provide the information that would otherwise be provided by its division into parts.\n\n17.9 If the bill of costs sets costs claimed against the LSC or Lord Chancellor only, the schedule may be set out in a separate document or, alternatively, may be included in the bill, shown separately from the costs claimed against other parties..\n\n17.10 The detailed assessment of the legal aid/ LSC schedule will take place immediately after the detailed assessment of the bill of costs but on occasions, the court may decide to conduct the detailed assessment of the legal aid/ LSC schedule separately from any detailed assessment of the bill of costs. This will occur, for example, where a default costs certificate is obtained as between the parties but that certificate is not set aside at the time of the detailed assessment of the legal aid costs.\n\n17.11 Where costs have been assessed at prescribed rates it is the responsibility of the legal representative to enter the correct figures allowed in respect of each item and to recalculate the summary of the legal aid/ LSC schedule. Detailed assessment procedure where costs are payable out of a fund other than the Community Legal Service fund or by the Lord Chancellor under part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012: rule 47.19\n\n18.1 Rule 47.19 enables the court to direct under rule 47.19(3) that the receiving party must serve a copy of the request for assessment and copies of the documents which accompany it, on any person who has a financial interest in the outcome of the assessment.\n\n18.2 A person has a financial interest in the outcome of the assessment if the assessment will or may affect the amount of money or property to which that person is or may become entitled out of the fund. Where an interest in the fund is itself held by a trustee for the benefit of some other person, that trustee will be treated as the person having such a financial interest unless it is not appropriate to do so. 'Trustee' includes a personal representative, receiver or any other person acting in a fiduciary capacity.\n\n18.3 The request for a detailed assessment of costs out of the fund should be in Form N 258 B, be accompanied by the documents set out at paragraph 17.2(1) (a) to (e) and the following-\n\n(a) a statement signed by the receiving party giving his name, email address, address for service, reference and telephone number,\n\n(b) a statement of the postal address of any person who has a financial interest in the outcome of the assessment; and\n\n(c) if a person having a financial interest is a child or protected party, a statement to that effect.\n\n18.4 The court will decide, having regard to the amount of the bill, the size of the fund and the number of persons who have a financial interest, which of those persons should be served and may give directions about service and about the hearing. The court may dispense with service on all or some of those persons.\n\n18.5 Where the court makes an order dispensing with service on all such persons it may proceed at once to make a provisional assessment, or, if it decides that a hearing is necessary, give appropriate directions. Before deciding whether a hearing is necessary, the court may require the receiving party to provide further information relating to the bill.\n\n18.6\n\n(1) The court will send the provisionally assessed bill to the receiving party with a notice in Form N 253. If the receiving party is legally represented the legal representative should, if the provisional assessment is to be accepted, then complete the bill.\n\n(2) The court will fix a date for a detailed assessment hearing, if the receiving party informs the court within 14 days after receiving the notice in Form N 253, that the receiving party wants the court to hold such a hearing.\n\n18.7 The court will give at least 14 days notice of the time and place of the hearing to the receiving party and to any person who has a financial interest and who has been served with a copy of the request for assessment.\n\n18.8 If any party or any person who has a financial interest wishes to make an application in the detailed assessment proceedings, the provisions of Part 23 (General Rules about Applications for Court Orders) apply.\n\n18.9 If the receiving party is legally represented the legal representative must complete the bill by inserting the correct figures in respect of each item and must recalculate the summary of the bill. Costs of detailed assessment proceedings - rule 47.20: offers to settle under part 36 or otherwise\n\n19 Where an offer to settle is made, whether under Part 36 or otherwise, it should specify whether or not it is intended to be inclusive of the cost of preparation of the bill and VAT. An offer which is made otherwise than under Part 36 should specify whether or not it is intended to be inclusive of interest. Unless the offer states otherwise it will be treated as being inclusive of all of these.\n\n(A Part 36 offer is treated as inclusive of interest: see CPR 36.5(4).) Appeals from authorised court officers in detailed assessment proceedings: rules 47.21 to 47.24\n\n20.1 This Section relates only to appeals from authorised court officers in detailed assessment proceedings. All other appeals arising out of detailed assessment proceedings (and arising out of summary assessments) are dealt with in accordance with Part 52 and Practice Directions 52 A to 52 E. The destination of appeals is dealt with in accordance with the Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals) Order 2016.\n\n20.2 In respect of appeals from authorised court officers, there is no requirement to obtain permission, or to seek written reasons.\n\n20.3 The appellant must file a notice which should be in Form N 161(an appellant's notice).\n\n20.4 The appeal will be heard by a costs judge or a District Judge of the High Court, and is a re-hearing.\n\n20.5 The appellant's notice should, if possible, be accompanied by a suitable record of the judgment appealed against. Where reasons given for the decision have been officially recorded by the court an approved transcript of that record should accompany the notice. Where there is no official record the following documents will be acceptable-\n\n(a) the officer's comments written on the bill;\n\n(b) advocates' notes of the reasons agreed by the respondent if possible and approved by the authorised court officer.\n\nWhen the appellant was unrepresented before the authorised court officer, it is the duty of any advocate for the respondent to make a note of the reasons promptly available, free of charge to the appellant where there is no official record or if the court so directs. Where the appellant was represented before the authorised court officer, it is the duty of the appellant's own former advocate to make a note available. The appellant should submit the note of the reasons to the costs judge or District Judge hearing the appeal.\n\n20.6 Where the appellant is not able to obtain a suitable record of the authorised court officer's decision within the time in which the appellant's notice must be filed, the appellant's notice must still be completed to the best of the appellant's ability. It may however be amended subsequently with the permission of the costs judge or District Judge hearing the appeal.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 48 - PART 2 OF THE LEGAL AID, SENTENCING AND PUNISHMENT OF OFFENDERS ACT 2012 RELATING TO CIVIL LITIGATION FUNDING AND COSTS: TRANSITIONAL PROVISION AND EXCEPTIONS\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements Part 48\n\n---\n\nTransitional Provisions: General\n\n---\n\n1.1\n\nSections 44 and 46 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 ('the 2012 Act') make changes to the effect that a costs order may not include, respectively, provision requiring the payment by one party of all or part of a success fee payable by another party under a conditional fee agreement or of an amount in respect of all or part of the premium of a costs insurance policy taken out by another party. These changes come into force on 1 April 2013.\n\n---\n\n1.2\n\nSections 44(6) and 46(3) of the 2012 Act make saving provisions to the effect, respectively, that these changes do not apply so as to prevent a costs order including such provision where the conditional fee agreement in relation to the proceedings was entered into (or, in relation to a collective conditional fee agreement, services were provided to the party under the agreement), or the costs insurance policy in relation to the proceedings taken out, before the date on which the changes come into force.\n\n---\n\n1.3\n\nThe provisions in the CPR relating to funding arrangements have accordingly been revoked (either in whole or in part as they relate to funding arrangements) with effect from 1 April 2013; but they will remain relevant, and will continue to have effect notwithstanding the revocations, after that date for those cases covered by the saving provisions.\n\n---\n\n1.4\n\nThe provisions in the CPR in force prior to 1 April 2012 relating to funding arrangements include -\n\n(a) CPR 43.2(1)(a), (k), (l), (m), (n), (o), 43.2(3) and 43.2(4);\n\n(b) CPR 44.3 A, 44.3 B, 44.12 B, 44.15 and 44.16;\n\n(c) CPR 45.8, 45.10, 45.12, 45.13, Sections III to V (45.15 to 45.19, 45.20 to 22 and 45.23 to 26), 45.28 and 45.31 to 45.40;\n\n(d) CPR 46.3;\n\n(e) CPR 48.8.\n\n---\n\nMesothelioma claims\n\n---\n\n2.1\n\nBy virtue of section 48 of the 2012 Act, the changes relating to recoverable success fees and insurance premiums which are made by sections 44 and 46 of the Act may not be commenced, and accordingly will not apply, in relation to mesothelioma claims (defined by section 48(2) of the Act as having the same meaning as in the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979) until such time as a review has been carried out and the conclusions of that review published. It will accordingly remain possible for a costs order in favour of a party to such proceedings to include provision requiring the payment of success fees and premiums under after the event costs insurance policies, and so the provisions of the CPR relating to funding arrangements as in force immediately prior to 1 April 2013 will continue to apply in relation to such proceedings, whether commenced before or after 1 April 2013. This will include the provision for fixed recoverable success fees in respect of employers' liability disease claims in Section V of Part 45 (CPR 45.23 to 45.26), which will otherwise cease to apply other than to claims in which a CFA was entered into or a costs insurance policy taken out before 1 April 2013).\n\n---\n\n2.2\n\nOn the later date when sections 44 and 46 are brought into force in relation to mesothelioma claims, the saving provisions of sections 44(6) and 44(3) will have effect in relation to funding arrangements in such claims as they do more generally, save that the operative date for the saving provisions will not be 1 April 2013 but the later date.\n\n---\n\nInsolvency-related proceedings and publication and privacy proceedings\n\n---\n\n3.1\n\nSections 44 and 46 of the 2012 Act are not being commenced immediately in relation to certain proceedings related to insolvency. Until such time as those sections are commenced in relation to those proceedings, therefore, they are in a similar position as regards funding arrangements to mesothelioma claims.\n\n---\n\n3.2\n\nSimilarly, sections 44 and 46 of the 2012 Act are not being commenced immediately in respect of publication and privacy proceedings, which will accordingly be in a similar position as regards funding arrangements to mesothelioma claims and insolvency-related proceedings until such time as those sections are commenced in relation to them.\n\n---\n\nNew provision in relation to clinical negligence claims\n\n---\n\n4.1\n\nSection 46 of the 2012 Act enables the Lord Chancellor by regulations to provide that a costs order may include provision requiring the payment of an amount in respect of all or part of the premium of a costs insurance policy, where -\n\n(a) the order is made in favour of a party to clinical negligence proceedings of a prescribed description;\n\n(b) the party has taken out a costs insurance policy insuring against the risk of incurring a liability to pay for one or more expert reports in respect of clinical negligence in connection with the proceedings (or against that risk and other risks);\n\n(c) the policy is of a prescribed description;\n\n(d) the policy states how much of the premium relates to the liability to pay for such an expert report or reports, and the amount to be paid is in respect of that part of the premium.\n\n---\n\n4.2\n\nThe regulations made under the power are the Recovery of Costs Insurance Premiums in Clinical Negligence Proceedings Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/92). The regulations relate only to clinical negligence cases where a costs insurance policy is taken out on or after 1 April 2013, so the provisions in force in the CPR prior to 1 April 2013 relating to funding arrangements will not apply.",

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 49 B - MESOTHELIOMA CLAIMS\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Part 49\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\nTitle\n\nNumber\n\nScope\n\nPara 1\n\nDefinitions\n\nPara 2\n\nStarting proceedings\n\nPara 3.1\n\nClaimants with severely limited life expectancy\n\nPara 4.1\n\nFixing the case management conference for other claims\n\nPara 5.1\n\nThe show cause procedure\n\nPara 6.1\n\nSetting the trial date\n\nPara 7.1\n\nTaking evidence by deposition\n\nPara 8\n\nCompliance with pre-action protocols\n\nPara 9\n\n---\n\nScope\n\n1.This Practice Direction applies to claims for compensation for mesothelioma.\n\n---\n\nDefinitions\n\n2.In this Practice Direction-'show cause procedure' means (without prejudice to the court's general case management powers in Part 3 of the CPR) the procedure set out in paragraph 6;'outline submissions showing cause' means an outline or skeleton argument of the defendant's case within the show cause procedure; and'standard interim payment' means the standard payment in respect of interim damages, and (if appropriate) interim costs and disbursements as determined from time to time by the Head of Civil Justice. The amount of this payment is currently £50,000.\n\n---\n\nStarting proceedings\n\n3.1.The claim form and every statement of case must be marked with the title 'Living Mesothelioma Claim' or 'Fatal Mesothelioma Claim' as appropriate.\n\n3.2.In order for the court to adopt the show cause procedure in the first case management conference, the claimant must file and serve any witness statements about liability (as are available)-(1) either-(a) at the same time as filing and serving the claim form and (where appropriate) the particulars of claim; or(b) as soon as possible after filing and serving the claim form and (where appropriate) the particulars of claim; and(2) in any event not less than 7 days before the case management conference.\n\n3.3.Any witness statement about liability must identify as far as is possible-(1) the alleged victim's employment history and history of exposure to asbestos;(2) the identity of any employer where exposure to asbestos of the alleged victim is alleged;(3) details of any self employment in which the alleged victim may have been exposed; and(4) details of all claims made and payments received under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979.\n\n3.4.The claimant must also attach to the claim form-(1) a work history from H M Revenue and Customs (where available); and(2) any pre-action letter of claim.\n\n---\n\nClaimants with severely limited life expectancy\n\n4.1.Where the claimant believes that the claim is particularly urgent then on issue of the claim form, the claimant-(1) may request in writing that the court file is placed immediately before a judge nominated to manage such cases in order to fix a case management conference; and(2) must explain in writing to the court why the claim is urgent.\n\n4.2.Where the court decides that the claim is urgent (and notwithstanding that a claim has not yet been served or a defence has not yet been filed) it will-(1) fix the date for the case management conference to take place within a short period of time; and(2) give directions as to the date by which the claimant must serve the claim form if it has not been served already.\n\n---\n\nFixing the case management conference for other claims\n\n5.1.Where paragraph 4 does not apply and-(1) a defence is filed by the defendant or one of the defendants (where there is more than one); or(2) the claimant has obtained a default judgment,the court file will be referred to a judge nominated to manage such cases and the judge will give directions for the date of the case management conference.\n\n5.2.Claims marked 'Living Mesothelioma Claim' will be given priority when fixing a case management conference.\n\n---\n\nThe show cause procedure\n\n6.1.The show cause procedure is a requirement by the court, of its own initiative and usually on a 'costs in the case' basis, for the defendant to identify the evidence and legal arguments that give the defendant a real prospect of success on any or all issues of liability. The court will use this procedure for the resolution of mesothelioma claims.\n\n6.2.At the first case management conference, unless there is good reason not to do so, the defendant should be prepared to show cause why-(1) a judgment on liability should not be entered against the defendant; and(2) a standard interim payment on account of damages and (if appropriate) costs and disbursements should not be made by the defendant by a specified date.\n\n6.3.At the first case management conference if liability remains in issue the court will normally order that the defendant show cause within a further given period.\n\n6.4.The order requiring the defendant to show cause within a further given period will direct-(1) that the defendant file and serve on the claimant by a specified date outline submissions showing cause and -(a) if the outline submissions are not filed and served by a specified date, judgment, for a sum to be determined by the court, will be entered against the defendant without the need for any further order and the defendant will be ordered to make a standard interim payment by a specified date; or(b) if the outline submissions are filed and served by the specified date, the claim will be listed for a show cause hearing; or(2) that the defendant show cause at a hearing on a date fixed by the court.\n\n6.5.At the first case management conference the court will-(1) fix the date or trial window for the determination of damages and give any other case management directions as appropriate where the defendant admits liability or judgment is entered;(2) fix the date or trial window for the determination of damages and give any other case management directions as appropriate where an order to show cause under paragraph 6.3 has been made (if the defendant subsequently shows cause then the determination date or trial window may be utilised for the trial of any issue); or(3) in cases in which there is to be a trial on liability, give directions including the date or window for the trial.\n\n6.6.Where the defendant fails to show cause on some issues, the court will normally enter judgment on those issues.\n\n6.7.Where the defendant fails to show cause on all issues, the court will enter judgment for a sum to be determined and will normally order that a standard interim payment be made.\n\n6.8.Where the defendant succeeds in showing cause on some or all issues, the court will order a trial of those issues. The court may also require the issue of quantum or apportionment (as appropriate) to be dealt with at the trial provided that it does not delay the date for the fixing of the trial.\n\n---\n\nSetting the trial date\n\n7.1.In Living Mesothelioma Claims the date of the determination of damages or the trial will generally not be more than 16 weeks following service of the claim form.\n\n7.2.In Fatal Mesothelioma Claims the hearing date may be more than 16 weeks following service of the claim form.\n\n---\n\nTaking evidence by deposition\n\n8.Any party who for good reason wishes evidence to be taken by deposition may apply to the court at any time for such an order. However, the court will normally expect that such a request is made at a case management conference. The order will include a direction for the recording of such evidence on DVD and for the provision of a transcript. The parties must also be prepared to arrange for the provision of equipment to view the DVD by the court.(Part 34 contains provisions for evidence to be taken by deposition.)\n\n---\n\nCompliance with pre-action protocols\n\n9.In Living Mesothelioma Claims the court may decide not to require strict adherence to Practice Direction (Pre-Action Conduct) and any relevant pre-action protocol.",

If the defendant fails to file his request within this period, and later makes such a request, the court may take the failure into account as a factor when deciding what order to make about costs.\n\n8.4 On receipt of the admission, the court will serve a copy on the claimant.\n\n8.5 The claimant may obtain judgment by filing a request in practice form N 228.\n\n8.6 On receipt of the request for judgment, the court will enter judgment in the terms of the defendant's admission and offer and for costs.\n\n8.7 If-\n\n(1) the claimant does not accept the defendant's admission and offer, and\n\n(2) the defendant does not appear on the hearing date fixed when the claim form was issued,\n\nthe court may treat the defendant's admission and offer as evidence of the facts stated in it for the purposes of sections 129(2)(a) and 135(2).\n\n---\n\nAdditional requirements about parties to the proceedings\n\n9.1 The court may dispense with the requirement in section 141(5) (all parties to a regulated agreement and any surety to be parties to any proceedings) in any claim relating to the regulated agreement, if-\n\n(1) the claim form has not been served on the debtor or the surety, and\n\n(2) the claimant either before or at the hearing makes an application (which may be made without notice) for the court to make such an order.\n\n9.2 In a claim relating to a regulated agreement where-\n\n(1) the claimant was not one of the original parties to the agreement, and\n\n(2) the former creditor's rights and duties under the agreement have passed to him by -\n\n(a) operation of law, or\n\n(b) assignment,\n\nthe requirement of section 141(5) (all parties to a regulated agreement and any surety to be parties to any proceedings) does not apply to the former creditor, unless the court otherwise orders.\n\n9.3 Where a claimant who is a creditor or owner makes a claim for a court order under section 86(2) (death of debtor or hirer where agreement is partly secured or unsecured) the personal representatives of the deceased debtor or hirer must be parties to the proceedings in which the order is sought, unless no grant of representation has been made to the estate.\n\n9.4 Where no grant of representation has been made to the estate of the deceased debtor or hirer, the claimant must make an application in accordance with Part 23 for directions about which persons (if any) are to be made parties to the claim as being affected or likely to be affected by the enforcement of the agreement.\n\n9.5 The claimant's application under paragraph 9.4:\n\n(a) may be made without notice, and\n\n(b) should be made before the claim form is issued.\n\n---\n\nNotice to be given to re-open a consumer credit agreement\n\n10.1 Paragraph 10.2 applies where-\n\n(1) a debtor or any surety intends to seek an order relating to an unfair relationship between a creditor and that debtor, arising out of a credit agreement (taken together with any related agreement);\n\n(2) a claim relating to that agreement or any related agreement has already begun; and\n\n(3) section 140 B(2)(b) or section 140 B(2)(c) applies.\n\n10.2 The debtor or surety must serve written notice of intention on the court and every other party to the claim within 14 days of service of the claim form.\n\n10.3 A debtor or surety (as the case may be) who serves a notice under paragraph 10.2 will be treated as having filed a defence for the purposes of the Consumer Credit Act procedure.",

SECTION B CLAIMS AND APPLICATIONS THAT MUST BE MADE UNDER PART 8\n\n4.1 The claimant must use the Part 8 procedure if the claim is listed in the table below.\n\n4.2 Section C of this Practice Direction contains special provisions modifying the Part 8 procedure, and where it does so, those provisions should be followed.

(Section 16 B contains provisions about making applications.)\n\n(3)Omitted\n\n(4)If the court receives an application to lift the stay, the court must refer the application to a judge for directions, which may include that the claim be sent out of Online Civil Money Claims.

It will only be appropriate for a legal adviser to consider a request if a provision elsewhere in the Civil Procedure Rules enables them to consider requests of this type.\n\n(7) After an online application has been made and unless the application is to be dealt with without notice, the respondent must provide initial information to assist with managing the future conduct of the application (\"respondent information\") by -\n\n(a) completing the relevant screens on the OCMC website;\n\n(b) submitting the completed screens to the court using the website;\n\n(c) if relevant and requested to do so by the court, confirming whether the respondent consents to the application.\n\n(8) If the respondent confirms that they had consented to the application and that their consent was given before the application was made, the application is to be treated as an application for a consent order and the requirements in rule 40.6(7)(c) and PD 40 B paragraph 3.4(3) are disapplied.\n\n(9) The respondent must provide their respondent information -\n\n(a) before 4 pm on the 5 thday after the date of notification of the online application; or\n\n(b) within such other time limit notified to the respondent at the same time that the respondent is notified of the online application as directed by the Designated Civil Judge Online.\n\n(10) In addition to any applications that are required to be made as on-paper applications under paragraph 7.45, the following applications must also be made as on-paper applications-\n\n(a) any application made before a claim has been issued;\n\n(b) any application for default judgment under paragraph 11.1 B(8) where there is a Mental Health Crisis Moratorium in place under the Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space Moratorium and Mental Health Crisis Moratorium) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020;\n\n(ba) any application for the determination of the amount of costs or disbursements under Civil Procedure Rule 45.64 (determination where all parties agree on all issues except costs);\n\n(c) any application relating to-\n\n(i) an appeal;\n\n(ii) enforcement; or\n\n(iii) insolvency; and\n\n(d) any application where any respondent is not already a party to the claim.\n\nOther applications\n\n16 B.2(1) If a party wishes to make an application that is not an online application or otherwise covered by a provision of this practice direction, the application must be made using the procedure set out in the rest of the Civil Procedure Rules.\n\n(2) Any application made under subparagraph (1) is to be made to the CTSC or, where the parties have received an order from a judge or \"legal adviser\"(as defined) at a County Court hearing centre, or have been informed that the claim is to be managed at a County Court hearing centre, that hearing centre. When the court receives any such application, the application must be considered by a judge or a \"legal adviser\" (as defined), if appropriate, who must give directions as to how the application is to be handled. The directions may include a direction that the claim is to be sent out of Online Civil Money Claims, unless the application is an application for the determination of costs or disbursements under Civil Procedure Rule 45.64, in which the case the directions must include that the claim be sent out of Online Civil Money Claims. SECTION 17 - PROCEDURE WHERE THE PARTIES MAKE A REQUEST TO THE COURT NOT COVERED BY ONLINE CIVIL MONEY CLAIMS\n\nProcedure where the parties make a request to the court not covered by online civil money claims\n\n17.1(1)If the claimant or defendant wants to make a request to the court which is not catered for by this practice direction but is permitted by a provision elsewhere in the Civil Procedure Rules or Practice Directions, or by a court order, that party must notify the CTSC or, where the parties have received an order from a judge or a \"legal adviser\" (as defined) at a County Court hearing centre, or have been informed that the claim is to be managed at a County Court hearing centre, that hearing centre. SECTION 18 - PARTIES OR THE COURT REQUIRING THE CLAIM TO BE SENT OUT OF ONLINE CIVIL MONEY CLAIMS\n\nThe claimant or defendant no longer wishes to take part in the Online Civil Money Claims\n\n18.1 If the claimant or defendant no longer wishes to take part in Online Civil Money Claims, they may request that the court sends the claim out. If the court receives such a request, it must refer the matter to a judge. The judge must then direct that the claim be sent out of the Online Civil Money Claims.\n\nCourt considers that a claim is not - or is no longer - suitable for Online Civil Money Claims\n\n18.2(1)Where a claim has not already been transferred out of Online Civil Money Claims but the court, at any stage, concludes that the claim is not suitable for Online Civil Money Claims, or is no longer suitable for it, or is otherwise not appropriate for it -\n\n(a) the court must transfer the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims, if the reason that the claim is not, or is no longer, suitable or appropriate for the pilot is that a party wishes to take a step in proceedings not catered for by the pilot; or\n\n(b) a judge must transfer the claim out.\n\n(2)When the court transfers a claim out of Online Civil Money Claims under paragraph (1)(a), the court must transfer the claim to the CNBC unless the claim had already been transferred to a County Court hearing centre, in which case the court must transfer the claim out of the pilot to that hearing centre. SECTION 19 - PROCESS FOR SENDING A CLAIM OUT OF ONLINE CIVIL MONEY CLAIMS WHERE NO OTHER PROVISION APPLIES\n\nProcess for sending a claim out of online civil money claims where no other provision applies\n\n19.1(1).If -\n\n(a) a provision of this practice direction requires the court or a judge to send a claim out of Online Civil Money Claims; or\n\n(b) under \"directions\" (as defined) a claim is to be sent out of Online Civil Money Claims, then this Section sets out the process for sending the claim out. If, however, another provision applies to a particular claim and sets out the whole or part of the process for sending out, that provision prevails to the extent that it is inconsistent with this Section.\n\n19.1(2)A judge must decide where to send a claim that is being sent out.\n\n19.1(3)To ensure that a claim is sent out of Online Civil Money Claims successfully, the court may give directions (as defined) about how the claim is to be sent out.The court may also give directions about the future management of the claim. Directions given under this paragraph may include directions changing how any of the Civil Procedure Rules or any of the other practice directions will apply to the claim.\n\n19.1(4)If the court sends a claim out of Online Civil Money Claims, the court must inform the claimant and defendant of this and must -\n\n(a) explain why the claim has been sent out; and\n\n(b) set out any directions given by the court.\n\n19.1(5)Once the court sends the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims, this practice direction will no longer apply to the claim, but the rest of the Civil Procedure Rules and other practice directions will continue to apply, with any changes that the court has directed and with the following modifications: any of the party's form N 180, N 181 or online directions questionnaires is treated as that party's completed directions questionnaire form N 180 or N 181 as appropriate, completed under Civil Procedure Rules Part 26. SECTION 20 - LEGAL ADVISERS Scope of this Section\n\n20.1(1)Omitted\n\n(2)This Section sets out what court powers (jurisdiction) a \"legal adviser\" (as defined) can use in relation to a claim in Online Civil Money Claims, and the limits on using those powers.

In brief, a legal adviser is a member of court staff who is a barrister, solicitor or Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives or a CILEX lawyer, who has been authorised to act as a legal adviser by relevant judges.) Jurisdiction of legal advisers - and limits on the jurisdiction\n\n20.2(1)A legal adviser may exercise the jurisdiction of the county court in relation to all the powers that are set out in the first column of Table A that is set out in the Schedule to this Section.\n\n(2)Legal advisers may only exercise a particular power in so far as it is not limited by anything in the second column of that Table A, or by any of the general limits on the exercise of powers set out in paragraph (3) below.\n\n(3)The general limits on legal advisers exercising any power are that -\n\n(a) a legal adviser must not make a final decision on any claim;\n\n(b) a legal adviser must not exercise any power in relation to a claim where the defendant's response is submitted to the court on paper rather than electronically except where the response is a defence of the whole of the claim and paragraph 10.3 applies;\n\n(c) if a legal adviser considers that a claim requires a hearing in advance of a trial, the legal adviser must send the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims;\n\n(d) if a claim is complicated, the legal adviser must send the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims to the \"preferred court\" (as defined); and\n\n(e) a legal adviser must not send a claim out of the pilot until the later of-\n\n(i) the end of the time for a party to request reconsideration by a judge of the legal adviser's decision (see paragraph 20.3(2 A) and (3)); or\n\n(ii) the determination of any reconsideration.\n\n(4)A claim is complicated and must be sent out of the pilot if -\n\n(a) the claim raises a substantial point of law;\n\n(b) the claim has a complicated factual background; or\n\n(c) more than one expert per claim is to provide an opinion.\n\n(5)A legal adviser may consider a claim to be complicated for any other reason, and if so the legal adviser must still send the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims to the \"preferred court\" (as defined). Reconsideration of a decision made by a legal adviser\n\n20.3(1)Decisions of a legal adviser will be made without a hearing.\n\n(2)A party may request any decision of a legal adviser to be reconsidered by a judge, and any request must be made on time.\n\n(2 A)If the legal adviser's decision related to a claim where the defendant's response-\n\n(a) was submitted on paper,\n\n(b) is a defence of the whole of the claim;\n\n(c) and paragraph 10.3 applies,\n\na request to have the legal adviser's decision reconsidered is made on time if it is submitted to the court within 12 days of the date of the decision\n\n(3)In all other cases, a request is made on time if it is submitted to the court within 7 days after the date of the decision.\n\n(4)The request may be made on paper, and sent to the Online Civil Money Claims address set out in paragraph 2.1(2), or online if that is available.\n\n(5)The request may include a summary of the issue and an explanation of why the reconsideration is sought.\n\n(6)Reconsideration will be by a judge, and will take place without a hearing. SCHEDULE TO SECTION 20: TABLE A\n\nPower or function\n\nlimit\n\nPower and obligation in paragraph 18.2 (requirement to send claim out of Online Civil Money Claims if claim considered unsuitable or inappropriate for it)\n\nThe legal adviser must send the claim to the preferred court (as defined), without giving any directions.\n\nIf, however, a party has specified particular accessibility requirements on their form, the legal adviser may send the claim to one or other of the claimant or defendant's specified courts as the legal adviser considers would be most appropriate given the parties' accessibility requirements\n\nPower to refer a claim to a judge if the legal adviser thinks that appropriate\n\nPower subject to power in entry 2 of this table (requirement to send claim out of Online Civil Money Claims if claim considered unsuitable or inappropriate for it)\n\nPower to direct the parties to supply additional information that the legal adviser considers reasonably necessary to enable the case to be progressed the most effectively\n\nPower to make directions about the management of a claim, including directions about listing the claim for a hearing\n\nPower to propose to a judge that a claim or defence be considered for possible strike out\n\nPower to carry out all functions allowed to be carried out by a legal adviser under Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 2 E\n\nInsofar as any functions arise in the context of Online Civil Money Claims, and subject to any limitations on those functions that are set out in that Practice Direction (as well as the limitations set out in this Section 20). SECTION 21 - CHANGE TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION - DIGITAL NOTICES OF CHANGE Change to legal representation - digital notices of change\n\n21.1(1)Unless using My HMCTS to file notice of a change of solicitor, a party complies with CPR 42.2(2)(a) by filing the notice of the change required by that rule -\n\n(a) at the CNBC; or\n\n(b) if the claim has been sent to a County Court hearing centre, at that hearing centre.\n\n21.1(2)A party may only use My HMCTS to file notice of change of solicitor where -\n\n(a) the claimant is legally represented and -\n\n(i) the change is from one legal representative to another; or\n\n(ii) the defendant who was acting in person is to be represented by a legal representative;\n\n(b) the claimant was acting in person is to be represented by a legal representative; or\n\n(c) the claimant is acting in person and the defendant was also acting in person but is to be represented by a legal representative, in circumstances where the incoming legal representative is registered with My HMCTS and has been provided with access to Online Civil Money Claims.\n\n21.1(3)If a party files a notice of change and does not use My HMCTS to file the notice, the court must transfer the claim out of Online Civil Money Claims to continue -\n\n(a) at the CNBC; or\n\n(b) if the claim has been sent to a County Court hearing centre, at that hearing centre, as if it had been started under CPR Part 7.\n\n21.1(4)If a notice of change is filed under sub-paragraph (2)(a)(ii) so the effect is that a previously unrepresented defendant is to be represented and My HMCTS is used to file the notice of change so that the claim remains in the pilot, from the point at which the notice is filed, the claim is to be treated and this practice direction applies, as a claim where all parties are represented.

In such circumstances it will not be necessary to make an order under paragraph 2 and such an order may not be made.\n\n4.Any hearing held in private under paragraph 2 must be recorded, where that is practicable, in a manner directed by the court. Where authorised under s.32 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 or s.85 A of the Courts Act 2003 (as inserted by the Coronavirus Act 2020), the court may direct the hearing to be video recorded, otherwise the hearing must be audio recorded.

It is intended to assess modifications to the rules and Practice Directions that may be necessary as a temporary measure during the Coronavirus pandemic to ensure that the administration of justice is carried out so as not to endanger public health. As such it\n\n(a) makes provision for parties to agree extensions of time to comply with procedural time limits in the CPR, Practice Directions and court orders; and\n\n(b) provides guidance to the court when considering applications for extensions of time and adjournments.\n\nIt further makes provision to clarify the meaning of paragraph 4 of Practice Direction 51 Y.

An application for such permission will be considered by the court on the papers. Any order made on the papers must, on application, be reconsidered at a hearing.\n\n4.In so far as compatible with the proper administration of justice, the court will take into account the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic when considering applications for the extension of time for compliance with directions, the adjournment of hearings, and applications for relief from sanctions.\n\n5.In paragraph 4 of Practice Direction 51 Y, the reference to 'application' in the final sentence is to be read as 'request'.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 51 ZC - THE SMALL CLAIMS PAPER DETERMINATION PILOT\n\n---\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\n1. General\n\n1.1 This Practice Direction is made under rule 51.2 and provides for a pilot scheme to be called the 'Small Claims Paper Determination Pilot' to test a procedure which will enable the court to direct that a small claim will be determined without a hearing without requiring the agreement of all parties, as is currently required under rule 27.10 (\"the Pilot\").\n\n1.2 The Pilot will commence on 01 June 2022 (\"the Commencement Date\") and will terminate on 31 October 2025 unless extended (the \"Pilot Period\"). Evaluation may be undertaken as the pilot proceeds and an interim report or reports may be made before the end of the pilot.\n\n1.3 Subject to paragraph 1.4 below, the Pilot shall apply to all small claims in the County Court sitting at Bedford, Luton, Guildford, Staines, Cardiff and Manchester (each a \"Pilot Court\" and together the \"Pilot Courts\") which are issued after the Commencement Date and shall not apply to existing proceedings.\n\n1.4 The Pilot shall not apply to small claims -\n\n(a) where the parties have followed the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents and proceedings have been started under Practice Direction 27 B; or\n\n(b )for housing disrepair.\n\n1.5 The Pilot will continue to apply after the end of the Pilot Period to any proceedings listed for determination without a hearing during the Pilot Period.\n\n1.6 For the purposes of the Pilot, where the provisions of this Practice Direction conflict with other provisions of the rules or other Practice Directions, including rule 27.10, this Practice Direction shall take precedence.\n\n---\n\n2. Transfers in and out of Pilot Courts\n\n2.1 If a small claim which does not fall within sub-paragraph 1.4 is transferred into a Pilot Court from a court which is not a Pilot Court, the Pilot will apply, and the court may direct that the small claim will be determined without a hearing.\n\n2.2 If a small claim is transferred out of a Pilot Court into a court which is not a Pilot Court, any order listing the matter for determination on paper made under the Pilot will remain in force, unless the transferee court makes a different order.\n\n---\n\n3. Re-allocation\n\n3.1 Where a small claim is listed for determination without a hearing pursuant to the Pilot and is subsequently re-allocated from the small claims track to another track, the listing for determination without a hearing will no longer apply and the court will make case management directions to trial.\n\n---\n\n4. Suitability for determination without a hearing\n\n4.1 A determination without a hearing can be a proportionate and efficient means of determining a small claim in cases where it is not necessary to hear oral evidence or oral advocacy to determine the issues justly.\n\n4.2\n\n(1) Form N 180 (Directions Questionnaire (Small Claims)) shall be amended before the Commencement Date to include a section requiring each party to indicate -\n\n(a) whether they consider that the claim is suitable for determination without a hearing; and\n\n(b) if not, why not;\n\n(\"the Amended Form N 180\").\n\n(2) The Amended Form N 180 shall remain in use by the County Court throughout the Pilot Period.\n\n4.3 During the Pilot Period, a Pilot Court may direct that a small claim which falls within the Pilot should be determined without a hearing-\n\n(a)if all parties agree; or\n\n(b) if, having considered the completed directions questionnaires in Amended Form N 180, the court considers it is suitable for determination without a hearing.\n\n4.4 Whether a small claim is suitable for determination without a hearing is a matter for judicial discretion to be exercised in accordance with the Overriding Objective. The types of small claims which may be suitable include-\n\n(a) a claim for compensation for flight delay or denial of boarding pursuant to EU Regulation 261/2004 and/or The Air Passenger Rights and Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019;\n\n(b) a claim arising out of the issuance of a parking ticket on private land; and\n\n(c) any other claim of £1000 or less by value where there is no significant factual dispute which requires oral evidence, and the issues are not of such complexity as to require oral advocacy.\n\n---\n\n5. Determination\n\n5.1 A Pilot Court will give the parties at least 21 days' notice of the date of the determination of a small claim without a hearing (\"date of determination\").\n\n5.2 Where a direction is made pursuant to sub-paragraph 4.3(b), any party may file at the Pilot Court short written submissions objecting to that direction no less than 7 days before the date of determination, which will be put before the judge at the time listed for the paper determination. The judge will consider the suitability of the small claim for paper determination afresh and may either continue with the paper determination or direct that it be listed for a hearing instead.\n\n5.3 Where the judge determines a small claim without a hearing under the Pilot, the judge will prepare a note of reasons (which shall include reasons for determining that it is suitable for determination without a hearing, if a party has objected pursuant to sub-paragraph 5.2) and the Pilot Court will send a copy to each party.\n\n5.4 For the purposes of the Pilot, rule 5.4 C(1) shall be read as if it included a new sub-section (c) as follows-\n\n\"5.4 C\n\n(1) The general rule is that a person who is not a party to proceedings may obtain from the court records a copy of-\n\n(a)…;\n\n(b)…;\n\n(c) a copy of a note of reasons prepared pursuant to PD 51 ZC.\".\n\n---\n\n6. Appeals\n\n6.1\n\n(1) A party who is dissatisfied with a determination without a hearing under the Pilot may not apply to set aside a judgment under rule 27.11 but may seek permission to appeal it pursuant to rule 52.3.\n\n(2) In considering such an appeal, the appeal court will take into account the summary nature of the note of reasons produced following a determination without a hearing.\".",

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 51 ZD - PILOT SCHEME FOR CAPPING COSTS IN PATENT CASES IN THE SHORTER TRIAL SCHEME\n\n---\n\nPLEASE NOTE THIS PRACTICE DIRECTION COMES INTO FORCE 1 JANUARY 2024\n\n---\n\nGeneral\n\n1.1 This Practice Direction is made under rule 51.2. It provides for a scheme for piloting the use of capped costs for patents cases in the Patents Court. The aim of the pilot scheme (\"the Pilot\") is to improve access to the Patents Court for litigants with cases which are less complex and less valuable but for which the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court is not appropriate, primarily through:\n\n(1) streamlining the procedures of the Patents Court;\n\n(2) lowering the costs of litigation;\n\n(3) increasing the certainty of costs exposure; and\n\n(4) speeding up the resolution of claims.\n\nStreamlined procedures meeting the objectives in paragraphs (1) and (4) are already available to litigants through the Shorter Trial Scheme in Practice Direction 57 AB (\"STS\"). The Pilot introduces an aggregate cap on the costs which can be recovered by the successful litigant for all patent cases in the Patents Court to which the STS applies to meet the objectives in paragraphs (2) and (3).\n\n1.2 The Pilot will last for three years, starting on 1 January 2024 and finishing on 31 December 2026 (\"the Pilot Period\"), and will apply to all claims which are issued in the STS in the Patents Court during the Pilot Period. Any cases proceeding within the Pilot at the end of the Pilot Period will remain subject to the procedure of the Pilot thereafter.\n\n1.3 This Practice Direction supplements the rules and Practice Direction applying to the STS and only addresses the additional provisions which shall apply to the STS patent cases to which the Pilot applies. For the purposes of the Pilot where the provisions of this Practice Direction conflict with other provisions of the rules or other Practice Directions, this Practice Direction will take precedence.\n\n---\n\nCosts\n\n---\n\nGeneral\n\n1.4 The provisions on costs in the STS shall apply save as and to the extent set out in this Practice Direction.\n\nAmount of capped costs\n\n1.5 Except insofar as otherwise provided in this section, the court will not order a party to pay total costs of more than:\n\n(1) £500,000 on the final determination of a claim in relation to liability; and\n\n(2) £250,000 on an inquiry as to damages or account of profits.\n\n1.6 The amount in paragraph 1.5 applies after the court has applied the provision on set off in accordance with rule 44.12(1)(a).\n\n1.7 Subject to assessment where appropriate, the following may be recovered in addition to the amount of costs assessed in accordance with paragraph 1.5:\n\n(1)court fees;\n\n(2)costs relating to the enforcement of any court order;\n\n(3)wasted costs; and\n\n(4)additional costs where the paying party has behaved unreasonably.\n\n1.8 Where appropriate, VAT may be recovered in addition to the costs awarded under this section, and any reference in this section to an amount of costs is a reference to those costs net of any such VAT.\n\n1.9 Where a party is entitled to costs for a part of the proceedings in question, the Court will apportion the costs cap taking into account that part of the proceedings in relation to the whole.\n\n---\n\nPart 36 offers\n\n1.10 Part 36 applies to proceedings in the Pilot subject to paragraphs 1.5 to 1.9 and 1.11 to 1.15.\n\n1.11 Where a Part 36 offer is made in proceedings in the Pilot and is accepted, rule 36.13 applies save that the Court shall apportion the costs cap taking into account the stage in the proceedings at which the relevant period expired.\n\n1.12 Where an offer is made in proceedings in the Pilot but is not accepted, rule 36.17 applies with the modifications in paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14.\n\n1.13 Where an order for costs is made pursuant to rule 36.17(3), the total of the costs awarded, not including any amounts awarded under paragraphs 1.7 and 1.8, shall not exceed the relevant amount in paragraph 1.5 and the Court shall take into account the proportion of the costs incurred by each party before and after the expiry of the relevant period and apportion the costs cap accordingly.\n\n1.14 Where an order for costs is made pursuant to rule 36.17(4), the total of the costs awarded, not including any amounts awarded under paragraphs 1.7 and 1.8, shall not exceed 125% of the relevant amount(s) in paragraph 1.5 and the Court shall take into account the proportion of the costs incurred by each party before and after the expiry of the relevant period and apportion the costs cap and the increased costs cap accordingly.\n\n1.15 Section 65 of the Patents Act 1977 (Certificate of Contested Validity) shall apply save that the total costs a court may order are not more than 125% of the amount in paragraph 1.5 (1) (plus any amounts awarded under paragraphs 1.7 and 1.8).",

or\n\n(ii) would be payable under Part 45 if that Part applied to the claim;\n\n(b) in proceedings which included a claim for an injunction or an order for specific performance a sum not exceeding the amount specified in Practice Direction 27 A for legal advice and assistance relating to that claim;\n\n(c) any court fees paid by that other party;\n\n(d) expenses which a party or witness has reasonably incurred in travelling to and from a hearing or in staying away from home for the purposes of attending a hearing;\n\n(e) a sum not exceeding the amount specified in Practice Direction 27 A for any loss of earnings or loss of leave by a party or witness due to attending a hearing or to staying away from home for the purposes of attending a hearing;\n\n(f) a sum not exceeding the amount specified in Practice Direction 27 A for an expert's fees;\n\n(g) such further costs as the court may assess by the summary procedure and order to be paid by a party who has behaved unreasonably;\n\n(h) the Stage 1 and, where relevant, the Stage 2 fixed costs in rule 45.18 where-\n\n(i) the claim was within the scope of the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents ('the RTA Protocol') or the Pre-action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury (Employers' Liability and Public Liability) Claims ('the EL/PL Protocol');\n\n(ii) the claimant reasonably believed that the claim was valued at more than the small claims track limit in accordance with paragraph 4.1(4) of the relevant Protocol; and\n\n(iii) the defendant admitted liability under the process set out in the relevant Protocol; but\n\n(iv) the defendant did not pay those Stage 1 and, where relevant, Stage 2 fixed costs; and\n\n(i) in an appeal, the cost of any approved transcript reasonably incurred.\n\n(2 A) When considering how to exercise its discretion to order or decline to order costs falling within paragraph (2) (including when considering under paragraph (2)(g) whether a party has behaved unreasonably), the court may also take into account any failure by a party to attend mediation provided by the Mediation Service under rule 26.6.\n\n(3) A party's rejection of an offer in settlement will not of itself constitute unreasonable behaviour under paragraph (2)(g) but the court may take it into consideration when it is applying the unreasonableness test.\n\n(4) The limits on costs imposed by this rule also apply to any fee or reward for acting on behalf of a party to the proceedings charged by a person exercising a right of audience by virtue of an order under section 11 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (a lay representative).\n\nPRACTICE DIRECTION 27 A\n\nAppendix B: STANDARD DIRECTIONS\n\n(For use where the district judge specifies no other directions)\n\nTHE COURT DIRECTS:\n\n1.Each party must deliver to every other party and to the court office copies of all documents on which they intend to rely at the hearing no later than [ ] [14 days before the hearing]. (These should include the letter making the claim and the reply; and, if a party failed to attend mediation provided by the Mediation Service, that party's explanation for that failure, and any other party's comments on the matter, with any supporting documents.)\n\n2 The original documents must be brought to the hearing.\n\n3[Notice of hearing date and time allowed.]\n\n4 The parties are encouraged to contact each other with a view to trying to settle the case or narrow the issues. However the court must be informed immediately if the case is settled by agreement before the hearing date.\n\n5 No party may rely at the hearing on any report from an expert unless express permission has been granted by the court beforehand. Anyone wishing to rely on an expert must write to the court immediately on receipt of this Order and seek permission, giving an explanation why the assistance of an expert is necessary.\n\nNOTE: Failure to comply with the directions may result in the case being adjourned and in the party at fault having to pay costs. The parties are encouraged always to try to settle the case by negotiating with each other. The court must be informed immediately if the case is settled before the hearing.\"\n\nPART 45\n\nUnreasonable behaviour\n\n45.13.-(1) Where, in a claim to which Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part applies, an order for costs is made in favour of a party whom the court considers has behaved unreasonably, the other party may apply for an order that those costs be reduced by an amount equivalent to 50% of the fixed recoverable costs which would otherwise be payable.\n\n(2) Where, in a claim to which Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part applies, an order for costs is made against a party whom the court considers has behaved unreasonably, the other party may apply for an order that those costs be increased by an amount equivalent to 50% of the fixed recoverable costs which would otherwise be payable.\n\n(2 A) The court may also make an order under paragraph (1) or (2) on its own initiative in any case where rule 26.6(6) applies.\n\n(3) In this rule-\n\n(a) unreasonable behaviour is conduct for which there is no reasonable explanation; and\n\n(b) \"fixed recoverable costs which would otherwise be payable\" does not include-\n\n(i) VAT;\n\n(ii)any additional amounts under rules 36.17 or 36.24; or (iii)any disbursements.",

    "content": "Document: Practice Direction 51ZF – Part 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021: provision during piloted commencement\nPart 1 of 2\n==================================================\nPRACTICE DIRECTION 51 ZF - PART 3 OF THE DOMESTIC ABUSE ACT 2021: PROVISION DURING PILOTED COMMENCEMENT\n\nI - SCOPE OF THIS PRACTICE DIRECTION AND INTERPRETATION 1. Scope and application of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 and associated practice directions\n\n1.1 This practice direction is made under rule 51.2 and applies to proceedings in the county court under Part 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 during the piloted commencement of that Part.\n\n1.2 The Civil Procedure Rules 1998 and associated practice directions apply to proceedings to which this practice direction applies, but where a provision of the rules, practice directions or Form N 244 (the specified court form for making an application, including an application for variation or discharge) conflict with this practice direction, this practice direction will take precedence.\n\n1.3 During the operation of the pilot, Practice Direction 2 B will apply as modified by paragraph 1.4.\n\n1.4 In paragraph 8.1 of Practice Direction 2 B, after sub-paragraph (c)(v), insert-\n\n\"(vi) Part 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021\".\n\n1.5 This practice direction adopts the same paragraph numbering as Practice Direction 36 ZG of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (the Family Practice Direction) where possible and, where relevant, corresponds with the Family Practice Direction.If a paragraph of the Family Practice Direction is not applicable, the corresponding paragraph in this practice direction is blank.\n\n(Unlike in the family court, the county court can only make a Domestic Abuse Protection Order in limited circumstances - both the person to be protected and the person against whom the order is sought must already be parties to existing relevant proceedings (which do not have to be domestic abuse related). 2. Interpretation\n\n2.1 In this practice direction-\n\n\"the 2021 Act\" means the Domestic Abuse Act 2021;\n\n\"DAPO\" means a domestic abuse protection order within the meaning of section 27 of the 2021 Act;\n\n\"P\" means the person against whom a DAPO is sought or against whom the DAPO has been made;\n\n\"personally connected\" has the meaning given by section 2 of the 2021 Act;\n\n\"person to be protected\" means-\n\n(a) the person who will be protected by the DAPO applied for or being considered by the court of its own initiative, if that order is made; or\n\n(b) the person who is being protected by the DAPO, where a DAPO has been made;\n\n\"piloted commencement\" means during any period when, pursuant to regulations made under section 90(7) to (9) of the 2021 Act, any provisions of Part 3 are in force only for a specified purpose, in relation to a specified area or for a specified period\";\n\n\"relevant occupant\" means a person within the meaning of section 33(2) of the 2021 Act\";\n\n\"responsible person\" means the person who is, or is to be, responsible for supervising or monitoring compliance with a positive requirement, or an electronic monitoring requirement, as the case may be;\n\n\"relevant proceedings\" means proceedings within the meaning of section 31(7) and (8) of the 2021 Act. II - APPLICATION FOR A DAPO 3. Required information for DAPO application in relevant proceedings\n\n3.2\n\n3.3\n\n3.4 An application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings must be made in accordance with paragraph 6 and set out the following information, if known-\n\n(a) whether the contact details for the applicant are to be kept confidential;\n\n(b)\n\n(c) where the application relates to a property-\n\n(i) the opinion of any relevant occupant about the making of an order; and\n\n(ii) details of any mortgagee or landlord of the property; and\n\n(d) details of-\n\n(i) the times and location of where P normally works or attends an educational or religious establishment;\n\n(ii) any other court order or injunction to which P is or was previously subject, including a DAPO made against P; and\n\n(iii) any application for a court order or injunction in respect of P, including a DAPO, which has been refused by the court.\n\n3.5\n\n3.6 An application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings must be served in accordance with paragraph 8.\n\n3.7 This paragraph applies to an application for variation or discharge of a DAPO as it applies to an application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings.\n\n(Section 32(2) of the 2021 Act provides that the first condition that a court must be satisfied of before making a DAPO is that on the balance of probabilities P has been abusive towards a person aged 16 or over to whom P is personally connected. Section 32(5) provides that a DAPO cannot be made against a person who is under the age of 18.)\n\n(The person to be protected may only apply for a DAPO to the county court in existing relevant proceedings where they and P are parties to those proceedings and the court would have the power under section 31(7) of the 2021 Act to make a DAPO in those proceedings.)\n\n(Section 28 of the 2021 Act enables an application for a DAPO to be made to the family court unless the person to be protected is applying in existing proceedings where they and P are parties and the court would have the power under section 31(2) to make a DAPO in those proceedings, in which case the application may be made to the family court or the Family Division of the High Court.)\n\n(Section 28 of the 2021 Act enables the appropriate chief officer of police, as defined in that section, to apply for a DAPO by complaint to a magistrates' court. In criminal proceedings, where P has been convicted or acquitted of an offence, the court dealing with the conviction or acquittal may make a DAPO against P (section 31(3) - (5) of the 2021 Act). And where the Crown Court in criminal proceedings allows a person's appeal against a conviction for an offence, it may make a DAPO against the person (section 31(6) of the 2021 Act).)\n\n(Section 33(3) of the 2021 Act provides that the court may make a DAPO without the consent of the person to be protected.) 4. Application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings without notice to P\n\n4.1 An application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings may be made without notice to P in accordance with paragraph 6.\n\n4.2\n\n4.3\n\n4.4\n\n4.5\n\n5. Permission to apply for a DAPO\n\n5.2\n\n5.3\n\n5.4\n\n5.5\n\n5.6\n\n5.7\n\n5.8\n\n5.9 6. Application for a DAPO in existing relevant proceedings\n\n6.1 An application for a DAPO in existing relevant proceedings under section 31(7) of the 2021 Act may be made only-\n\n(a) to the county court;\n\n(b) by the person to be protected; and\n\n(c) where the person to be protected and P are both parties to those proceedings.\n\n6.2 The application may be made-\n\n(a) orally or in writing; and\n\n(b) without notice to P.\n\n6.3 Subject to paragraph 6.5(a), if the application is made in writing it must be-\n\n(a) made using Form N 244;\n\n(b) contain the information required by paragraph 3.4; and\n\n(c) supported by a witness statement.\n\n6.4 If the application is made orally, the applicant must detail the information required by paragraph 3.4 to the court.\n\n6.5 If the application is made without notice to P and-\n\n(a) in writing-\n\n(i) the applicant must explain why notice has not been given in Form N 244; and\n\n(ii) it must detail the information required by paragraph 3.4; or\n\n(b) orally, the applicant must-\n\n(i) explain to the court why notice has not been given; and\n\n(ii) detail the information required by paragraph 3.4 to the court.\n\n6.6 Where the application is made on notice it must be served in accordance with paragraph 8.\n\n6.7 If the applicant has detailed that their contact details are to be kept confidential, the court must consider whether they should be kept confidential.\n\n6.8 This paragraph applies to an application for any variation or discharge of a DAPO in existing relevant proceedings as it applies to an application for a DAPO in existing relevant proceedings.\n\n(Section 34(1) of the 2021 Act enables the court to make a DAPO without notice to P where it is just and convenient to do so. Where the court makes a DAPO without notice to P, it must provide P with an opportunity to make representations about the order as soon as just and convenient at a hearing (section 34(4).) III - PARTIES 7. Parties\n\n7.2\n\n7.3 Where the applicant is a child aged 16 or 17, who does not have a litigation friend, the court must consider if the child should have a litigation friend to conduct the proceedings on the child's behalf.\n\n7.4 A person, including the person to be protected, may make an application to the court for permission for a person to be removed, added or substituted as a party under Part 23.\n\n7.5\n\n7.6\n\n7.7\n\n7.8\n\n7.9 This paragraph applies to proceedings for any variation or discharge of a DAPO as it applies to proceedings for a DAPO.\n\n(Part 19 makes provision about the addition and substitution of parties and Part 21 makes general provision about the appointment of a litigation friend.) IV - SERVICE OF APPLICATIONS 8. Service of DAPO application in relevant proceedings\n\n8.1 Where a DAPO application is made in relevant proceedings on notice, subject to paragraph 8.2, the applicant must serve a copy of the DAPO application and supporting statement, if made in writing, together with notice of the hearing on-\n\n(a) P, personally, unless the application is made without notice to P; and\n\n(b)\n\n(c) any other person directed by the court,\n\nnot less than 2 days before the date on which the application will be heard.\n\n8.2 The court may direct that-\n\n(a) service is effected by an alternative method or at an alternative place; or\n\n(b) service be dispensed with.\n\n(c)\n\n8.3 Where the applicant is-\n\n(a)\n\n(b) represented, service must be effected by their representative or the representative's agent; and\n\n(c) acting in person, the court officer must effect service.\n\n8.4 The court may abridge the period specified in paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.5 Service on any person other than P (who must be served personally) must be in accordance with Part 6.\n\n8.6\n\n8.7\n\n8.8 Where the DAPO application relates to a property and sets out details of any mortgagee or landlord of the property pursuant to paragraph 3.4(c)(ii), the applicant must serve on the mortgagee or landlord-\n\n(a) a copy of the application, if made in writing; and\n\n(b) notice of the right to make representations in writing.\n\n8.9 A certificate of service stating the date and time of service on each person served must be filed by-\n\n(a) the person who served the DAPO application and any other documents; or\n\n(b) the representative of the person.\n\n8.10 This paragraph applies to service of an application for variation or discharge of a DAPO as it applies to service of an application for a DAPO.\n\n(Rule 6.27 enables the court to direct that service is effected by an alternative method or at an alternative place and rule 6.28 enables the court to dispense with service.) 9. Service of application for a DAPO in relevant proceedings without notice to P\n\n9.1 Where an application for a DAPO is made in relevant proceedings without notice to P, service must be effected in accordance with paragraph 8.\n\n9.2\n\n9.3\n\n9.4\n\n9.5\n\n9.6\n\n9.7\n\n10. Service of application for a DAPO in existing relevant proceedings\n\n10.1 Where an application for a DAPO is made in existing relevant proceedings, service must be effected in accordance with paragraph 8.\n\n10.2\n\n10.3\n\n10.4\n\n10.5\n\n10.6 V - DAPO PROCEEDINGS 11. Hearings\n\n11.1 Subject to paragraph 11.2, any hearing relating to proceedings under this Practice Direction will be in private unless the court directs otherwise.\n\n11.2 Where-\n\n(a) the DAPO application or the application for variation or discharge of the DAPO is made in existing relevant proceedings under paragraph 6; or\n\n(b) the court is considering making, varying or discharging a DAPO, in relevant proceedings, under paragraph 16,\n\nthe hearing must be-\n\n(i) in public, if the relevant proceedings are in public; or\n\n(ii) in private, if the relevant proceedings are in private,\n\nunless the court directs otherwise. 12. Representations in respect of DAPOs\n\n12.1 Where the court makes a DAPO without notice to P under paragraph 6 (or varies or discharges a DAPO under paragraph 22) it must fix a hearing date, to consider any representations made by P.\n\n12.2 Where the court makes a DAPO of its own initiative under paragraph 16 (or varies or discharges a DAPO of its own initiative under paragraph 22), it may direct that a hearing be held to consider any representations made by any of the persons served with the DAPO under paragraph 16 including where a DAPO is varied or discharged by the court under paragraph 22.\n\n12.3 Where the order relates to a property and details of any mortgagee or landlord of the property were set out in the DAPO application pursuant to paragraph 3.4(c)(ii), the court may direct that a hearing be held to consider any representations made by the mortgagee or landlord.\n\n12.4 An order made under paragraph 12.1 must be served in accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraph 17.\n\n12.5 Where the court makes an order under paragraph 12.2 or 12.3, it must give directions as to how the order, and any other documents directed by the court, are to be served. VI - PROVISIONS IMPOSED BY A DAPO 13. General\n\n13.1 This paragraph applies where the court makes or varies a DAPO-\n\n(a) on application; or\n\n(b) of its own initiative.\n\n13.2 The court must-\n\n(a) have regard to the terms of a DAPO already made against P ('the previous order'), if any;\n\n(b) where a previous order has been made, consider whether the DAPO ('the new order') should specify that it takes effect on the previous order ceasing to have effect; and\n\n(c) tell P about the notification requirements that P must comply with under sections 41 and 42 of the 2021 Act.\n\n13.3 A DAPO must set out-\n\n(a) the requirements which are to be imposed on P; and\n\n(b) the duration-\n\n(i) of each requirement imposed on P; and\n\n(ii) for which the order is to have effect.\n\n(Section 35(1) of the 2021 Act specifies that 'requirement' includes any prohibition or restriction.)\n\n(Section 36(1) of the 2021 Act provides that requirements imposed on P by a DAPO must not, as far as practicable, conflict with P's religious beliefs, interfere with the times at which P normally works or attends an educational establishment or conflict with the requirements of any other court order or injunction to which P is subject.)\n\n(Sections 41 and 42 of the 2021 Act impose mandatory notification requirements on P. Within 3 days of a DAPO being made, P must notify the police of their name and home address. And P must notify the police of any changes to such details within 3 days of it happening.) 14. Including a positive requirement in a DAPO\n\n14.1 This paragraph does not apply in relation to electronic monitoring requirements (in relation to which paragraph 15 makes provision).\n\n14.2 The court may not include in a DAPO a requirement that P do something (a \"positive requirement\"), including on variation of a DAPO, until it has received evidence about the suitability and enforceability of the proposed positive requirement under section 36(3) of the 2021 Act, from the person who is to be responsible for supervising compliance with the requirement.\n\n14.3 The evidence under paragraph 14.2 may be given orally or in writing.\n\n14.4 Where the evidence under paragraph 14.2-\n\n(a) has been taken, the court may make a DAPO which includes the positive requirement; or\n\n(b) has not been taken, the court may-\n\n(i) make an interim DAPO which does not include the positive requirement; and\n\n(ii) give directions for the taking of the evidence to determine whether to include the positive requirement in the DAPO once the evidence has been taken.\n\n14.5 Any directions given by the court under paragraph 14.4(b)(ii) must specify the time within which the person who is to be responsible for supervising compliance is to submit the evidence to the court.\n\n14.6 Where the court makes a DAPO that includes a positive requirement, it must tell P about the obligations that P must comply with under section 36(7) of the 2021 Act.\n\n14.7 Where the DAPO includes a positive requirement, the court officer must-\n\n(a) inform the responsible person of-\n\n(i) P's name, address and, if available, telephone number; and\n\n(ii) details of the requirement to be supervised by the responsible person;\n\n(b) inform P of the responsible person's identity and the means by which the responsible person may be contacted; and\n\n(c) notify the responsible person of any variation or discharge of the positive requirement. 15.

DAPOs made by the court in existing relevant proceedings\n\n16.1 Where the county court makes a DAPO of its own initiative under section 31(7) of the 2021 Act, it must-\n\n(a) have regard to the requirements of paragraph 13.2; and\n\n(b) set out in the order-\n\n(i) a summary of its reasons for making the order;\n\n(ii) the names of the persons who are to be served with the order; and\n\n(iii) the requirements of paragraph 13.3.\n\n16.2 The court may order service of the order (and any other documents directed by the court) on-\n\n(a) any of the parties to the current proceedings;\n\n(b) any other person whom the court considers should be served; and\n\n(c) any mortgagee or landlord where the DAPO relates to a property and details of the mortgagee or landlord of the property were set out in any DAPO application pursuant to paragraph 3.4(c)(ii).\n\n16.3 Where P is to be served, service must be effected personally, unless the court directs otherwise.\n\n16.4 Subject to paragraph 16.5, service on any person other than P (who must be served personally) must be in accordance with Part 6.\n\n16.5 Where the person to be served is a child-\n\n(a) unless the court directs otherwise, the court officer must not effect service; and\n\n(b) the court must give directions as to how service is to be effected.\n\n16.6 This paragraph applies to the court varying or discharging a DAPO of its own initiative in existing proceedings as it applies to the court making a DAPO of its own initiative in existing proceedings. VII - SERVICE OF DAPO MADE BY THE COURT 17. Service of DAPO made in relevant proceedings\n\n17.1 Where a DAPO is made by the court in relevant proceedings, subject to paragraph 17.2, the applicant must serve a copy of the DAPO, as soon as reasonably practicable, on-\n\n(a) P, personally; and\n\n(b)\n\n(c) any other person named in the order.\n\n17.2 The court may direct that-\n\n(a) service is effected by an alternative method or at an alternative place; or\n\n(b) service be dispensed with.\n\n(c)\n\n17.3 Where the applicant is-\n\n(a)\n\n(b) represented, service must be effected by their representative or the representative's agent; and\n\n(c) acting in person, the court officer must effect service.\n\n17.4 Service on any person other than P (who is to be served personally) must be in accordance with Part 6.\n\n17.5\n\n17.6\n\n17.7 Where the DAPO relates to a property and details of any mortgagee or landlord of the property were set out in the DAPO application pursuant to paragraph 3.4(c)(ii), the applicant must serve a copy of the DAPO on the mortgagee or landlord of the property.\n\n17.8 Where the DAPO application was made without notice to P, the applicant must also serve a copy of the application for the DAPO together with supporting statement, if made in writing, on P, personally.\n\n17.9 A certificate of service stating the date and time of service on each person served must be filed by-\n\n(a) the person who served the DAPO and any other documents; or\n\n(b) the representative of the person.\n\n17.10 This paragraph applies to service of a DAPO varied or discharged by the court as it applies to service of a DAPO made by the court. 18.

    "content": "Document: Part 52 – Appeals\nSection: VII REOPENING FINAL APPEALS Reopening of final appeals\nPart 2 of 4\n==================================================\n(1) In this rule, \"Aarhus Convention claim\" and \"prohibitively expensive\" have the same meanings as in Section IX of Part 46, and \"claimant\" means a claimant to whom rules 46.26 to 46.28 apply.\n\n(2) In an appeal against a decision made in an Aarhus Convention claim to which rules 46.26 to 46.28 apply, the court must-\n\n(a) consider whether the costs of the proceedings will be prohibitively expensive for a party who was a claimant; and\n\n(b) if they will be, make an order limiting the recoverable costs to the extent necessary to prevent this.\n\n(3) When the court considers the financial resources of a party for the purposes of this rule, it must have regard to any financial support which any person has provided or is likely to provide to that party. Appeal court's powers\n\n52.20\n\n(1) In relation to an appeal the appeal court has all the powers of the lower court.\n\n(Rule 52.1(4) provides that this Part is subject to any enactment that sets out special provisions with regard to any particular category of appeal. Where such an enactment gives a statutory power to a tribunal, person or other body, it may be the case that the appeal court may not exercise that power on an appeal.)\n\n(2) The appeal court has power to-\n\n(a) affirm, set aside or vary any order or judgment made or given by the lower court;\n\n(b) refer any claim or issue for determination by the lower court;\n\n(c) order a new trial or hearing;\n\n(d) make orders for the payment of interest;\n\n(e) make a costs order.\n\n(3) In an appeal from a claim tried with a jury the Court of Appeal may, instead of ordering a new trial-\n\n(a) make an order for damages; or\n\n(b) vary an award of damages made by the jury.\n\n(4) The appeal court may exercise its powers in relation to the whole or part of an order of the lower court.\n\n(Part 3 contains general rules about the court's case management powers.)\n\n(5) If the appeal court-\n\n(a) refuses an application for permission to appeal;\n\n(b) strikes out an appellant's notice; or\n\n(c) dismisses an appeal,\n\nand it considers that the application, the appellant's notice or the appeal is totally without merit, the provisions of paragraph (6) must be complied with.\n\n(6) Where paragraph (5) applies-\n\n(a) the court's order must record the fact that it considers the application, the appellant's notice or the appeal to be totally without merit; and\n\n(b) the court must at the same time consider whether it is appropriate to make a civil restraint order. Hearing of appeals\n\n52.21\n\n(1) Every appeal will be limited to a review of the decision of the lower court unless-\n\n(a) a practice direction makes different provision for a particular category of appeal; or\n\n(b) the court considers that in the circumstances of an individual appeal it would be in the interests of justice to hold a re-hearing.\n\n(2) Unless it orders otherwise, the appeal court will not receive-\n\n(a) oral evidence; or\n\n(b) evidence which was not before the lower court.\n\n(3) The appeal court will allow an appeal where the decision of the lower court was-\n\n(a) wrong; or\n\n(b) unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity in the proceedings in the lower court.\n\n(4) The appeal court may draw any inference of fact which it considers justified on the evidence.\n\n(5) At the hearing of the appeal, a party may not rely on a matter not contained in that party's appeal notice unless the court gives permission. Non-disclosure of Part 36 offers and payments\n\n52.22\n\n(1) Unless the appeal court otherwise orders, the fact that a Part 36 offer or payment into court has been made must not be disclosed to any judge of the appeal court who is to hear or determine-\n\n(a) an application for permission to appeal\n\n(b) an appeal;\n\nuntil all questions (other than costs) have been determined.\n\n(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply if the Part 36 offer or payment into court is relevant to the substance of the appeal.\n\n(3) Paragraph (1) does not prevent disclosure in any application in the appeal proceedings if disclosure of the fact that a Part 36 offer or payment into court has been made is properly relevant to the matter to be decided.\n\n(Rule 36.4 has the effect that a Part 36 offer made in proceedings at first instance will not have consequences in any appeal proceedings. Therefore, a fresh Part 36 offer needs to be made in appeal proceedings. However, this rule applies to a Part 36 offer whether made in the original proceedings or in the appeal.) V SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE COURT OF APPEAL Assignment of appeals to the Court of Appeal\n\n52.23\n\n(1) Where the court from or to which an appeal is made or from which permission to appeal is sought (\"the relevant court\") considers that-\n\n(a) an appeal which is to be heard by the County Court or the High Court would raise an important point of principle or practice; or\n\n(b) there is some other compelling reason for the Court of Appeal to hear it,\n\nthe relevant court may order the appeal to be transferred to the Court of Appeal.\n\n(The Master of the Rolls has the separate statutory power to direct that an appeal which would be heard by the County Court or the High Court should be heard instead by the Court of Appeal - see section 57 of the Access to Justice Act 19994.)\n\n(2) The Master of the Rolls or the Court of Appeal may remit an appeal to the court in which the original appeal was or would have been brought.

Paragraphs (5) and (6) of this rule provide the procedure for the calling into question of such decisions.) VI SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO STATUTORY APPEALS\n\nStatutory appeals - court's power to hear any person\n\n52.25\n\n(1) In a statutory appeal any person may apply for permission-\n\n(a) to file evidence; or\n\n(b) to make representations at the appeal hearing.\n\n(2) An application under paragraph (1) must be made promptly.

Such an appeal may only be allocated to a Recorder in exceptional circumstances.\n\n---\n\nApplications within appeals to the High Court and within the County Court\n\n4.5 A\n\n(1) Where the appeal is an appeal to the High Court or within the County Court, any judge who may hear the appeal, could be authorised to hear the appeal or to whom the appeal could be allocated may-\n\n(a) hear any application made within the appeal, including an application for a stay but excluding an application for permission to appeal; and\n\n(b) give directions in the appeal.\n\n(2) In addition, where the appeal is to the High Court and is from the decision of a Circuit Judge sitting in the County Court, a Group C Judge may-\n\n(a) hear any application made within the appeal, including an application for a stay but excluding an application for permission to appeal; and\n\n(b) give directions in the appeal.\n\n---\n\nAppeal in relation to case management decision\n\n4.6 Where the application is for permission to appeal from a case management decision, the court dealing with the application may take into account whether -\n\n(a) the issue is of sufficient significance to justify the costs of an appeal;\n\n(b) the procedural consequences of an appeal (e.g. loss of trial date) outweigh the significance of the case management decision;\n\n(c) it would be more convenient to determine the issue at or after trial.\n\nCase management decisions include decisions made under rule 3.1(2) and decisions about disclosure, filing of witness statements or experts' reports, directions about the timetable of the claim, adding a party to a claim and security for costs.\n\n---\n\nSecond appeal\n\n4.7 Unless paragraph 4.8 applies an application for permission to appeal from a decision of the High Court or a county court which was itself made on appeal is a second appeal and must be made to the Court of Appeal. If permission to appeal is granted the appeal will be heard by the Court of Appeal.\n\n4.8 Where in contempt proceedings the first appeal is determined by the Divisional Court or a single judge of the High Court a second appeal lies to the Supreme Court with permission.\n\n---\n\nSECTION V - SKELETON ARGUMENTS\n\n5.1\n\n(1) The purpose of a skeleton argument is to assist the court by setting out as concisely as practicable the arguments upon which a party intends to rely.\n\n(2) A skeleton argument must-\n\n• be concise;\n• both define and confine the areas of controversy;\n• be set out in numbered paragraphs;\n• be cross-referenced to any relevant document in the bundle;\n• be self-contained and not incorporate by reference material from previous skeleton arguments;\n• not include extensive quotations from documents or authorities.\n\n(3) Documents to be relied on must be identified.\n\n(4) Where it is necessary to refer to an authority, a skeleton argument must -\n\n(a) state the proposition of law the authority demonstrates; and\n\n(b) identify the parts of the authority that support the proposition.\n\nIf more than one authority is cited in support of a given proposition, the skeleton argument must briefly state why.\n\n(5) The cost of preparing a skeleton argument which -\n\n(a) does not comply with the requirements set out in this paragraph; or\n\n(b) was not filed within the time limits provided by this Practice Direction (or any further time granted by the court),\n\nwill not be allowed on assessment except as directed by the court.\n\n5.2 The parties should consider what other information the appeal court will need. This may include a list of persons who feature in the case or glossaries of technical terms. A chronology of relevant events will be necessary in most appeals.\n\n5.3 Any statement of costs must show the amount claimed for the skeleton argument separately.\n\n---\n\nSECTION VI - DISPOSING OF APPLICATIONS AND APPEALS BY CONSENT\n\n---\n\nDismissal of applications or appeals by consent\n\n6.1 An appellant who does not wish to pursue an application or appeal may request the appeal court to dismiss the application or the appeal. If such a request is granted it will usually be subject to an order that the appellant pays the costs of the application or appeal.\n\n6.2 If the appellant wishes to have the application or appeal dismissed without costs, his request must be accompanied by a letter signed by the respondent stating that the respondent so consents.\n\n6.3 Where a settlement has been reached disposing of the application or appeal, the parties may make a joint request to the court for the application or appeal to be dismissed by consent. If the request is granted the application or appeal will be dismissed.\n\n---\n\nAllowing unopposed appeals or applications on paper\n\n6.4 The appeal court will not normally make an order allowing an appeal unless satisfied that the decision of the lower court was wrong or unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity. The appeal court may, however, set aside or vary the order of the lower court by consent and without determining the merits of the appeal if it is satisfied that there are good and sufficient reasons for so doing. Where the appeal court is requested by all parties to allow an application or an appeal the court may consider the request on the papers. The request should set out the relevant history of the proceedings and the matters relied on as justifying the order and be accompanied by a draft order.\n\n---\n\nDisposal of applications and appeals involving children or protected parties\n\n6.5 Where one of the parties is a child or protected party, any disposal of an application or the appeal requires the court's approval. A draft order signed by the parties' solicitors should be sent to the appeal court, together with an opinion from the advocate acting on behalf of the child or protected party and, in the case of a protected party, any relevant documents prepared for the Court of Protection.\n\n---\n\nSECTION VII - REOPENING APPEALS (RULE 52.30)\n\n7.1 A party applying for permission to reopen an appeal or an application for permission to appeal must apply for such permission from the court whose decision the party wishes to reopen.\n\n7.2 The application for permission must be made by application notice and be supported by written evidence, verified by a statement of truth. A copy of the application for permission must not be served on any other party to the original appeal unless the court so directs.\n\n7.3 Where the court directs that the application for permission is to be served on another party, that party may, within 14 days of the service on him of the copy of the application, file and serve a written statement either supporting or opposing the application.\n\n7.4 The application for permission will be considered on paper by a single judge.\n\n---\n\nSECTION VIII - TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n8.1 This Practice Direction and Practice Directions 52 B, 52 C, 52 D and 52 E shall come into force on 1 October 2012 and shall apply to all appeals where -\n\n(a) the appeal notice was filed; or\n\n(b) permission to appeal was given\n\non or after that date.\n\n8.2 The appeal court may at any time direct that, in relation to any appeal, one or more of Practice Directions 52 A, 52 B, 52 C, 52 D or 52 E shall apply irrespective of the date on which the appeal notice was filed or permission to appeal was given.",

In most cases an application for permission to appeal will be determined without the need for the respondent to attend a hearing. In such circumstances an order for costs will not normally be made in favour of a respondent who voluntarily attends a hearing.\n\n(2) If the court directs the respondent to file submissions or attend a hearing, it will normally award costs to the respondent if permission is refused.\n\n---\n\nSECTION V - TIMETABLE\n\n21.Subject to any specific directions that may be given by the court, the timetable for the conduct of an appeal after the date of the listing window notification is set out below:\n\nTimetable Part 1 - Listing window notification to lodging bundle\n\n• the appellant's notice if permission has been given by the lower court or is not needed;\n• notification that permission has been granted by the Court of Appeal; or\n• notification that the permission application will be listed with the appeal to follow\n\nParagraph 13 (respondent's skeleton argument where no Respondent's Notice filed)\n\nParagraph 31 (skeleton argument)\n\nTimetable Part 2 - Steps to be taken once hearing date fixed: lodging bundles, supplemental skeletons and bundles of authorities\n\n---\n\nSECTION VI - MANAGEMENT OF THE APPEAL\n\nListing and hear-by dates\n\n22.The hear-by date is the last day of the listing window.\n\nAppeal Questionnaire\n\n23.The appellant must complete and file the Appeal Questionnaire and serve it on the respondent within 14 days after the date of the listing window notification.\n\n---\n\nTime estimates\n\n24.If the respondent disagrees with the appellant's time estimate, the respondent must inform the court within 7 days of service of the Appeal Questionnaire.

APPEALS TO THE COUNTY COURT Appeals under sections 204 and 204 A of the Housing Act 1996\n\n28.1\n\n(1) An appellant should include appeals under section 204 and section 204 A of the Housing Act 1996 in one appellant's notice.\n\n(2) If it is not possible to do so (for example because an urgent application under section 204 A is required) the appeals may be included in separate appellant's notices.\n\n(3) An appeal under section 204 A may include an application for an order under section 204 A(4)(a) requiring the authority to secure that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation.\n\n(4) If, exceptionally, the court makes an order under section 204 A(4)(a) without notice, the appellant's notice must be served on the authority together with the order. Such an order will normally require the authority to secure that accommodation is available until a hearing date when the authority can make representations as to whether the order under section 204 A(4)(a) should be continued.\n\n(5) Unless the court orders otherwise -\n\n(a) the appellant shall file and serve its proposed case management directions for the appeal together with the appellant's notice;\n\n(b) the respondent shall within 14 days thereafter either agree those directions or file and serve alternative proposed directions;\n\n(c) within 14 days after service of the appellant's notice the respondent must disclose any documents relevant to the decision under appeal, in so far as not previously disclosed;\n\n(d) within 14 days after receipt of any documents disclosed under sub-paragraph (c) the appellant may make any amendments to its grounds of appeal which arise out of those documents.

Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976\n\n30.1 Where one of the grounds upon which an appeal against a notice under sections 21, 23 or 35 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 is brought is that -\n\n(a) it would have been fairer to serve the notice on another person; or\n\n(b) that it would be reasonable for the whole or part of the expenses to which the appeal relates to be paid by some other person,\n\nthat person must be made a respondent to the appeal, unless the court, on application of the appellant made without notice, otherwise directs.

Representation of the People Act 1983 - special provision in relation to anonymous entries in the register\n\n31.2\n\n(1) In this paragraph -\n\n(a) 'anonymous entry' has the meaning given by section 9 B(4) of the Representation of the People Act 1983;\n\n(b) 'appeal notice' means the notice required by regulation 32 of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001.\n\n(2) This paragraph applies to an appeal to the County Court to which paragraph 31.1 (Representation of the People Act 1983 - appeals against decisions of registration officers) applies if a party to the appeal is a person -\n\n(a) whose entry in the register is an anonymous entry; or\n\n(b) who has applied for such an entry.\n\n(3) This paragraph also applies to an appeal to the Court of Appeal from a decision of the County Court in an appeal to which paragraph 31.1 applies.\n\n(4) The appellant may indicate in the appeal notice that an application for an anonymous entry has been applied for, or that the entry in the register is an anonymous entry.\n\n(5) The respondent or any other person who applies to become a party to the proceedings may indicate in a respondent's notice or an application to join the proceedings that the entry in the register is an anonymous entry, or that an application has been made for an anonymous entry.\n\n(6) Where the appellant gives such an indication in the appeal notice, the court will refer the matter to a District Judge for directions about the further conduct of the proceedings, and, in particular, directions about how the matter should be listed in the court list.\n\n(7) Where the court otherwise becomes aware that a party to the appeal is a person referred to in sub-paragraph (2), the court will give notice to the parties that no further step is to be taken until the court has given any necessary directions for the further conduct of the matter. Representation of the People Act 1983, National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) Order 2007 and Recall of MPs Act 2015 - appeals selected as test cases\n\n31.3\n\n(1) Where two or more appeals under-\n\n(a) section 56, and the 2001 Regulations;\n\n(b) article 5 of, and paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 to, the 2007 Order; or\n\n(c) regulations 74 and 77 of the 2016 Regulations,\n\ninvolve the same point of law, the court may direct that one appeal (\"the test-case appeal\") is to be heard first as a test case.\n\n(2) The court will send a notice of the direction to each party to all of those appeals.\n\n(3) Where a notice under sub-paragraph (2) is served on any party to an appeal (other than the test-case appeal), that party may (within 7 days after the notice is served on that party) give notice to the court requesting the appeal to be heard and-\n\n(a) the court will hear that appeal after the test-case appeal is disposed of;\n\n(b) the court will give the parties to that appeal notice of the day on which it will be heard; and\n\n(c) the party who gave the notice is not entitled to receive any costs of the separate hearing of that appeal unless the judge otherwise orders.\n\n(4) Where no notice is given under sub-paragraph (3) within the period limited by that paragraph -\n\n(a) the decision on the test-case appeal binds the parties to each of the other appeals;\n\n(b) without further hearing, the court will make, in each other appeal, an order similar to the order in the test-case appeal; and\n\n(c) the party to each other appeal who is in the same interest as the unsuccessful party to the selected appeal is liable for the costs of the test-case appeal in the same manner and to the same extent as the unsuccessful party to that appeal and an order directing the party to pay such costs may be made and enforced accordingly.\n\n(5) Sub-paragraph (4)(a) does not affect the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal of any party to an appeal other than the test-case appeal.

If the claimant does not know to whom the statement was published or it is impracticable to set out all such persons, then the particulars of claim must include all facts and matters relied upon to show (a) that such publication took place, and (b) the extent of such publication;\n\n(3) the facts and matters relied upon in order to satisfy the requirement of section 1 of the Defamation Act 2013 that the publication of the statement complained of has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant, or, in the case of a body that trades for profit, that it has caused or is likely to cause the body serious financial loss;\n\n(4) the imputation(s) which the claimant alleges that the statement complained of conveyed, both-\n\n(a) as to its natural and ordinary meaning; and\n\n(b) by way of any innuendo meaning (that is, a meaning alleged to be conveyed to some person by reason of knowing facts extraneous to the statement complained of). In the case of an innuendo meaning, the claimant must also identify the relevant extraneous facts;\n\n(5) full details of the facts and matters on which the claimant relies in support of the claim for damages. A claimant who seeks aggravated or exemplary damages must provide the information specified in rule 16.4(1)(c).\n\n4.3 Where a defendant relies on the defence under section 2 of the Defamation Act 2013 that the imputation conveyed by the statement complained of is substantially true, they must-\n\n(1) specify the imputation they contend is substantially true; and\n\n(2) give details of the matters on which they rely in support of that contention.\n\n4.4 Where a defendant relies on the defence under section 3 of the Defamation Act 2013 that the statement complained of was a statement of honest opinion, they must-\n\n(1) specify the imputation they seek to defend as honest opinion; and\n\n(2) set out the facts and matters relied on in support of their case that-\n\n(a) the statement complained of indicated, in general or specific terms, the basis of the opinion; and\n\n(b 0 an honest person could have held that opinion on the basis of any fact which existed at the time it was published or anything asserted to be a fact in a privileged statement published before the statement complained of.\n\n4.5 Where a defendant alleges that the statement complained of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matter of public interest under section 4 of the Defamation Act 2013, they must-\n\n(1) specify the matter of public interest relied upon; and\n\n(2) give details of all matters relied on in support of any case that they reasonably believed that publishing the statement was in the public interest.\n\n4.6 Where a defendant alleges that the statement complained of was published on a privileged occasion, they must specify the circumstances they rely on in support of that contention.\n\n4.7 Where a defendant relies on a defence under section 2(truth), section 3 (honest opinion), or section 4 (publication on a matter of public interest) of the Defamation Act 2013, the claimant must serve a reply specifically admitting, not admitting, or denying that defence and setting out the claimant's case in response to each fact alleged by the defendant in respect of it.\n\n4.8(1) If the defendant contends that any of the statement complained of, or any part thereof, was honest opinion, or was published on a privileged occasion, and the claimant intends to allege that the defendant did not hold the opinion or acted with malice (as applicable), the claimant must serve a reply giving details of the facts or matters relied on.\n\n(2) If the defendant relies on any other defence, and the claimant intends to allege that the defence is not available because of the defendant's state of mind, the claimant must serve a reply giving details of the facts or matters relied on. This includes-\n\n(a) where a defendant relies on the defence under section 4 of the Defamation Act 2013 and the claimant intends to allege that the defendant did not reasonably believe that the publication was in the public interest;\n\n(b) where a defendant relies on the defence under section 4(2) of the Defamation Act 1996 (offer to make amends) and the claimant intends to allege that the defendant had the state of mind referred to in section 4(3) of the defamation Act 1996.\n\n4.9 A defendant who relies on an offer to make amends under section 2 of the Defamation Act 1996 as their defence must-\n\n(1) state in their defence-\n\n(a) that they are relying on the offer in accordance with section 4(2) of the Defamation Act 1996; and\n\n(b) that it has not been withdrawn by them or been accepted; and\n\n(2) attach a copy of the offer made with their defence.\n\nCourt's powers in connection with an offer of amends\n\n5.1 Sections 2 to 4 of the Defamation Act 1996 make provision for a person who has made a statement which is alleged to be defamatory to make an offer to make amends. Section 3 provides for the court to assist in the process of making amends.\n\n5.2 A claim under section 3 of the Defamation Act 1996 made other than in existing proceedings may be made under CPR Part 8-\n\n(1) where the parties agree on the steps to make amends, and the sole purpose of the claim is for the court to make an order under section 3(3) for an order that the offer be fulfilled; or\n\n(2) where the parties do not agree-\n\n(a) on the steps to be taken by way of correction, apology and publication (see section 3(4));\n\n(b) on the amount to be paid by way of compensation (see section 3(5)); or\n\n(c) on the amount to be paid by way of costs (see section 3(6)).\n\n(Applications in existing proceedings made under section 3 of the Defamation Act 1996 must be made in accordance with CPR Part 23.)\n\n5.3(1) A claim or application under section 3 of the Defamation Act 1996 must be supported by written evidence.\n\n(2) The evidence referred to in paragraph (1) must include-\n\n(a) a copy of the offer of amends;\n\n(b) details of the steps taken to fulfil the offer of amends;\n\n(c) a copy of the text of any correction and apology;\n\n(d) details of the publication of the correction and apology;\n\n(e) a statement of the amount of any sum paid as compensation;\n\n(f) a statement of the amount of any sum paid for costs;\n\n(g) why the offer is unsatisfactory.\n\n(3) Where any step specified in section 2(4) of the Defamation Act 1996 has not been taken, then the evidence referred to in paragraph (2)(c) to (f) must state what steps are proposed by the party to fulfil the offer of amends and the date or dates on which each step will be fulfilled and, if none, that no proposal has been made to take that step.\n\nDetermination of meaning\n\n6.1 At any time in a defamation claim the court may determine-\n\n(1) the meaning of the statement complained of;\n\n(2) whether the statement is defamatory of the claimant at common law;\n\n(3) whether the statement is a statement of fact or opinion.\n\n6.2 An application for a determination of meaning may be made at any time after the service of particulars of claim. Such an application should be made promptly.\n\n6.3 Where an application is made for a determination of meaning, the application notice must state that it is an application for a determination of meaning made in accordance with this practice direction.\n\n6.4 An application made under this paragraph must be made to a Judge.\n\n(Rule 3.3 applies where the court exercises its powers on its own initiative.)\n\n(Following a determination of meaning the court may exercise its power under rule 3.4.)\n\nSummary disposal\n\n7.1 Where an application is made for summary disposal, the application notice must state-\n\n(1) that it is an application for summary disposal made in accordance with section 8 of the Defamation Act 1996; and\n\n(2) the matters set out in paragraph 2(3) of Practice Direction 24.\n\n7.2 An application for summary disposal may be made at any time after the service of particulars of claim.\n\n(This provision disapplies for these applications the usual time restriction on making applications in rule 24.4.)\n\n7.3(1) This paragraph applies where-\n\n(a) the court has ordered the defendant in defamation proceedings to agree and publish a correction and apology as summary relief under section 8(2) of the Defamation Act 1996; and\n\n(b) the parties are unable to agree its content within the time specified in the order.\n\n(2) Where the court grants this type of summary relief under the Act, the order will specify the date by which the parties should reach agreement about the content, time, manner, form and place of publication of the correction and apology.\n\n(3) Where the parties cannot agree the content of the correction and apology by the date specified in the order, then the claimant must prepare a summary of the judgment given by the court and serve it on all the other parties within 3 days following the date specified in the order.\n\n(4) Where the parties cannot agree the summary of the judgment prepared by the claimant they must within 3 days of receiving the summary -\n\n(a) file with the court and serve on all the other parties a copy of the summary showing the revisions they wish to make to it; and\n\n(b) apply to the court for the court to settle the summary.\n\n(5) The court will then itself settle the summary and the judge who delivered the judgment being summarised will normally do this.\n\nMISUSE OF PRIVATE OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\n8.1 In a claim for misuse of private information, the claimant must specify in the particulars of claim (in a confidential schedule if necessary to preserve privacy)-\n\n(1) the information as to which the claimant claims to have (or to have had) a reasonable expectation of privacy;\n\n(2) the facts and matters upon which the claimant relies in support of the contention that they had (or have) such a reasonable expectation;\n\n(3) the use (or threatened use) of the information by the defendant which the claimant claims was (or would be) a misuse; and\n\n(4) any facts and matters upon which the claimant relies in support of their contention that their rights not to have the specified information used by the defendant in the way alleged outweighed (or outweigh) any rights of the defendant to use the information in that manner.\n\n8.2 In a claim for misuse of confidential information or breach of confidence, the claimant must specify in the particulars of claim (in a confidential schedule if necessary to preserve confidentiality)-\n\n(1) the information said to be confidential;\n\n(2) the facts and matters upon which the claimant relies in support of the contention that it was (or is) confidential information that the defendant held (or holds) under a duty or obligation of confidence;\n\n(3) the use (or threatened use) of the information by the defendant which the claimant claims was (or would be) a misuse of the information or breach of that obligation.\n\nDATA PROTECTION\n\n9.In any claim for breach of any data protection legislation the claimant must specify in the particulars of claim-\n\n(1) the legislation and the provision that the claimant alleges the defendant has breached;\n\n(2) any specific data or acts of processing to which the claim relates;\n\n(3) the specific acts or omissions said to amount to such a breach, and the claimant's grounds for that allegation; and\n\n(4) the remedies which the claimant seeks.\n\nHARASSMENT\n\n10.1 This paragraph applies to claims for harassment arising from publication or threatened publication via the media, online, or in speech.\n\n10.2 Rule 65.28(1)(a) shall not apply, and the claim should be commenced under the Part 7 procedure.\n\n10.3 The claimant must specify in the particulars of claim (in a schedule if necessary) the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute a course of conduct which amount to (and which were known or ought to have been known by the defendant to amount to) harassment, including specific details of any actual or threatened communications.\n\n10.4 A defendant must in any defence specifically admit or deny each act alleged in the particulars of claim to constitute part of a course of conduct amounting to harassment.\n\n(Rule 16.5 contains requirements as to the contents of defences.)",

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 54 A - JUDICIAL REVIEW\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements Part 54\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\nSECTION I - GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO JUDICIAL REVIEW\n\n1.1 In addition to Part 54 and this Practice Direction attention is drawn to: (a) CPR Part 1; (b)section 31 of the Senior Courts Act 1981; (c) the Human Rights Act 1998; and (d) the Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide\n\n---\n\nThe Court\n\n2.1(1) Part 54 claims for judicial review are dealt with in the Administrative Court.\n\n(2) In exercise of the power under section 18(6) of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, the Lord Chief Justice has directed that certain classes of claims for judicial review fall within the jurisdiction of the Upper Tribunal: see the directions dated 21 August 2013 and 24 October 2014.\n\n(3) Practice Direction 54 C contains provisions about where a claim for judicial review may be started, administered and heard. CPR rule 7.1 A provides the general rule that claims against Welsh public bodies challenging the lawfulness of their decisions are to be issued and heard in Wales.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.5-Time Limit for Filing Claim Form\n\n3.1 Where the claim is for a quashing order in respect of a judgment, order or conviction, the date when the grounds to make the claim first arose, for the purposes ofrule 54.5(1)(b), is the date of that judgment, order or conviction.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.6-Claim Form\n\nGeneral\n\n4.1(1) A claimant seeking permission to apply for judicial review, urgent consideration or interim relief (whether by a claim included in the Claim Form itself or by a separate application notice) must ensure that the Claim Form or application notice sets out all material facts, that is all those facts which are relevant to the claim or application being made. A claimant must make proper and necessary inquiries before seeking permission to apply for judicial review or interim relief to ensure so far as reasonably possible that all relevant facts are known.\n\n(2) A claimant should refer to any statutory provision which excludes the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the application, or to grant the relief sought, and should also refer to any alternative appeal mechanism that exists, or could have been used prior to seeking judicial review\n\nContents of the Claim Form\n\n4.2(1) The Claim Form must include or be accompanied by the following documents-\n\n(a) a clear and concise statement of the facts relied on set out in numbered paragraphs - \"the Statement of Facts\"; and\n\n(b) a clear and concise statement of the grounds for bringing the claim - \"the Statement of Grounds\". The Statement of Grounds should: identify in separate, numbered paragraphs each ground of challenge; identify the relevant provision or principle of law said to have been breached; and provide sufficient detail of the alleged breach to enable the parties and the court to identify the essential issues alleged to arise. The Statement of Grounds should succinctly explain the claimant's case by reference to the Statement of Facts and state precisely what relief is sought.\n\n(2) The Statement of Facts and the Statement of Grounds may be contained in a single document.\n\n(3) The Statements of Facts and Grounds should be as concise as possible. The two documents together (or the single document if the two are combined) shall not exceed 40 pages. In many cases the court will expect the documents to be significantly shorter than 40 pages. The court may grant permission to exceed the 40-page limit.\n\n4.3 Any application (a) to extend the time limit for filing the Claim Form; and/or (b) for directions in the claim, should be included in or contained in a document that accompanies the Claim Form.\n\n4.4(1) In addition, the Claim Form must be accompanied by-\n\n(a) any written evidence in support of the claim (in this regard, see alsorules 8.5(1)and 8.5(7)).\n\n(b) any written evidence in support of any other application contained in the Claim Form;\n\n(c) a copy of any order that the claimant seeks to have quashed;\n\n(d) where the claim for judicial review relates to a decision of a court or tribunal, an approved copy of the reasons for reaching that decision;\n\n(e) where the claim is directed to the decision of any other public authority, a copy of any record of the decision under challenge;\n\n(f) copies of any documents on which the claimant proposes to rely;\n\n(g) copies of any relevant statutory material; and\n\n(h) a list of essential documents for advance reading by the court (with page references to the passages relied on).\n\n(2) Where it is not possible to file all the above documents, the claimant must indicate which documents have not been filed and the reasons why they are not currently available.\n\nThe claim bundle\n\n4.5(1) The claimant must prepare a paginated and indexed bundle containing all the documents referred to in paragraphs 4.2 and 4.4. An electronic version of the bundle must also be prepared in accordance with the Guidance on the Administrative Court website.\n\n(2) The claimant shall (unless otherwise requested) lodge the bundle with the Court in both electronic and hard copy form. For Divisional Court cases the number of hard copy bundles required will be one set for each judge hearing the case.\n\nInterested parties\n\n4.6(1) Any person who is an interested party (see rule 54.1(2)(f)) must be named in the Claim Form as such (seerule 54.6(1)(a)), and served with the Claim Form (seerule 54.7(b).\n\n(2) Where the claim for judicial review relates to proceedings in a court or tribunal, any other party to those proceedings will be an interested party in the judicial review proceedings. For example, if the defendant in a criminal case in the Magistrates or Crown Court applies for judicial review of a decision in that case, the prosecution must always be named as an interested party in the judicial review claim.\n\nHuman rights\n\n4.7 Where the claimant is seeking to raise any issue under the Human Rights Act 1998, or seeks a remedy available under that Act, the Claim Form must include the information required by paragraph 14.1 of Practice Direction 16.\n\nDevolution issues\n\n4.8(1) In this Practice Direction \"devolution issue\" has the same meaning as inparagraph 1, Schedule 9 to the Government of Wales Act 2006,paragraph 1, Schedule 10 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998; andparagraph 1, Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998.\n\n(2) Where the claimant intends to raise a devolution issue, the Claim Form must: (a) specify that the claimant wishes to raise a devolution issue and identify the relevant provisions of the Government of Wales Act 2006, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 or the Scotland Act 1998; and (b) contain a summary of the facts, circumstances and points of law on the basis of which it is alleged that a devolution issue arises.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.7-Service of Claim Form\n\n5.1 Part 6 contains provisions about the service of Claim Forms. Except as required byrules 54.11 or 54.12(2), the Administrative Court will not serve documents and service must be effected by the parties.\n\n5.2 Where the defendant or interested party to the claim for judicial review is-\n\n(a) the Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal, the address for service of the Claim Form is-\n\n(by post)\n\nCustomer Investigations Team\n\nOperations Directorate - HMCTS\n\nPost Point 5.12\n\n102 Petty France\n\nLondon\n\nSW 1 H 9 AJ\n\n(by e-mail)\n\nLitigation_Team_C@justice.gov.uk\n\n(b) the Crown, service of the Claim Form must be effected on the solicitor acting for the relevant government department as if the proceedings were civil proceedings as defined in the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. Practice Direction 66 gives the list published undersection 17 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 of the solicitors acting in civil proceedings (as defined in that Act) for the different government departments on whom service is to be effected, and of their addresses.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.8-Acknowledgment of Service\n\n6.1 The Acknowledgment of Service must contain the information specified at rules 8.3(2) and 10.5.\n\n6.2(1) If a defendant chooses to file an Acknowledgement of Service, the Summary Grounds referred to in CPR 54.8(4)(a) should meet the following requirements.\n\n(2) The Summary Grounds should identify succinctly any relevant facts. Material matters of factual dispute (if any) should be identified. The Grounds should provide a brief summary of the reasoning underlying the measure in respect of which permission to apply for judicial review is sought unless the defendant gives reasons why the application for permission can be determined without that information.\n\n(3) The Summary Grounds should (again succinctly) explain the legal basis of defendant's response to the claimant's case, by reference to relevant facts.\n\n(4) The Summary Grounds should be as concise as possible. Summary Grounds shall not exceed 30 pages. In many cases the court will expect the Summary Grounds to be significantly shorter. The court may grant permission to exceed the 30-page limit.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.8 A - Reply to acknowledgment of service\n\n7.1(1) A Reply should be filed only if necessary for the purpose of the court's decision to grant permission to apply for judicial review, for example, where a discrete issue not addressed in the Claim Form is raised in the Acknowledgement of Service. A Reply is not the occasion to rehearse matters already referred to in the Claim Form.\n\n(2) A Reply shall be as concise as possible and shall not exceed 5 pages. The court may grant permission to exceed the 5-page limit.\n\n7.2 If a Reply is filed unnecessarily, the court may make any order it considers appropriate, whether as to costs or otherwise.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.10-Permission Given\n\nDirections\n\n8.1 Case management directions underrule 54.10(1)may include directions about serving the Claim Form and any evidence on other persons.\n\n8.2 Where a claim is made under the Human Rights Act 1998, a direction may be made for giving notice to the Crown or joining the Crown as a party. Attention is drawn torule 19.4 A(parties to Human Rights Act claims) and paragraph 6 of Practice Direction 19 A (giving notice to the Crown of claims for declarations of incompatibility).\n\nRule 54.12-Permission decision without a hearing\n\n8.3 In the first instance, the court will generally consider the question of permission without a hearing.\n\nPermission hearings\n\n8.4 Neither the defendant nor any other interested party need attend a hearing on the question of permission unless the court directs otherwise.\n\n8.5 Where the defendant or any party does attend a hearing, the court will not generally make an order for costs against the claimant.\n\nRenewed applications for permission\n\n8.6 The purpose of the request to reconsider a decision to refuse permission (rule 54.12(3)) is to identify the scope of the renewed application. The request must be succinct. It should identify which grounds are relied on in support of the renewed application, and address the reasons given by the Judge who refused permission on consideration of the papers.\n\n8.7 The standard time estimate for the hearing of a renewed application is 30 minutes (to include time for judgment). Any request for a longer listing must be stated in the application. In any event, within 7 days following the date the application was filed, the parties must tell the Court the agreed time estimate for the hearing.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.11-Service of Order Giving or Refusing Permission\n\n9.1 An order refusing permission or giving it subject to conditions or on certain grounds only must set out or be accompanied by the court's reasons for coming to that decision.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.14-Response\n\n10.1(1) If a party required to file Detailed Grounds has already filed Summary Grounds, he may (if all relevant matters have already been addressed in the Summary Grounds) inform the court and all other parties that the Summary Grounds will stand as his Detailed Grounds.\n\n(2) If a party files and serves Detailed Grounds, that document should be as concise as possible, and shall not exceed 40 pages. The court may grant permission to exceed the 40-page limit.\n\n(3) Where a party filing Detailed Grounds intends to rely on written evidence or on documents not already filed, he must prepare a paginated and indexed bundle containing that evidence and those documents. An electronic version of the bundle shall also be prepared in accordance with the Guidance on the Administrative Court website.\n\n10.2 The party shall file and serve electronic and hard copy versions of the bundle when he files and serves the Detailed Grounds.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.16-Evidence\n\n11.1 In accordance with the duty of candour, the defendant should, in its Detailed Grounds or evidence, identify any relevant facts, and the reasoning, underlying the measure in respect of which permission to apply for judicial review has been granted.\n\n11.2 Disclosure is not required unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n11.3 It will rarely be necessary in judicial review proceedings for the court to hear oral evidence. Any application under rule 8.6(2) for permission to adduce oral evidence or to cross-examine any witness must be made promptly, in accordance with the requirements of Part 23, and be supported by an explanation of why the evidence is necessary for the fair determination of the claim.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.15-Where Claimant Seeks to Rely on Additional Grounds\n\n12.1 Where the claimant intends to apply for judicial review on grounds additional to those set out in the Claim Form, the claimant must make an application to the court for permission to amend the Claim Form. The application should be made in accordance with the requirements of Part 23.\n\n12.2 The application must be made promptly and should include, or be accompanied by, a draft of the amended grounds and be supported by evidence explaining the need for the proposed amendment and any delay in making the application for permission to amend.\n\n12.3 The application, the proposed additional grounds and any written evidence, must be served on the defendant and any interested party named in the Claim Form or Acknowledgement of Service.\n\n12.4 For the purposes of determining an application to rely on additional grounds, rules 17.1 and 17.2 shall apply. Where permission to rely on additional grounds is given, the court may give directions as to amendments to be made to the defendant's Grounds or Detailed Grounds and/or such other case management directions as appropriate.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.17-Court's Powers to Hear Any Person\n\n13.1 An application for permission to intervene under rule 54.17 should be made by application in the relevant proceedings, in accordance with the provisions of Part 23.\n\n13.2 Any such application must be made promptly. The Court is unlikely to accede to an application to intervene if it would have the consequence of delaying the hearing of the relevant proceedings.\n\n13.3 The Application Notice must be served on all parties to the proceedings.\n\n13.4(1) The duty of candour applies. The Application Notice should explain who the applicant is and indicate why and in what form the applicant wants to participate in the hearing.\n\n(2) If the applicant requests permission to make representations at the hearing, the application should include a summary of the representations the applicant proposes to make.\n\n(3) If the applicant requests permission to file and serve evidence in the proceedings a copy of that evidence should be provided with the Application Notice. The application should explain the relevance of any such evidence to the issues in the proceedings.\n\n13.5 If the applicant is seeking a prospective order as to costs which departs from the provision made by section 87 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015, the application must include a copy of the order sought and must set out the grounds on which that order is sought.\n\n13.6 Where the court gives permission for a person to file evidence or make representations at the hearing of the claim for judicial review (whether orally or in writing), it may do so on conditions and may give case management directions.\n\n13.7 Where all the parties consent, the court may deal with an application underrule 54.17 without a hearing.\n\n---\n\nRule 54.20-Transfer\n\n14.1 Rule 30.5 provides the power to transfer proceedings between Divisions of the High Court and to and from a specialist list. In deciding whether a claim is suitable for transfer to the Administrative Court, the court will consider whether it raises issues of public law to which Part 54 should apply.\n\n---\n\nSkeleton arguments\n\n15.1 The purpose of a skeleton argument is to assist the court by setting out as concisely as practicable the arguments upon which a party intends to rely.\n\n15.2(1) A skeleton argument must be concise. It should both define and confine the areas of controversy; be set out in numbered paragraphs; be cross-referenced to any relevant document in the bundle; be self-contained and not incorporate by reference material from previous skeleton arguments or pleadings; and should not include extensive quotations from documents or authorities. Documents to be relied on must be identified.\n\n(2) Where it is necessary to refer to an authority, a skeleton argument must: state the proposition of law the authority demonstrates; and identify the parts of the authority that support the proposition. If more than one authority is cited in support of a given proposition, the skeleton argument must briefly state why.\n\n15.3 Skeleton Arguments shall not exceed 25 pages. The court may grant permission to exceed the 25-page limit.\n\n15.4 Any skeleton argument that does not comply with the requirements above may be returned to its author by the Administrative Court Office and may not be re-filed unless and until it complies with those requirements. The court may disallow the cost of preparing a skeleton argument which does not comply with these requirements.\n\n15.5 The claimant must file and serve a skeleton argument not less than 21 days before the date of the hearing (or the warned date).\n\n15.6 The defendant and any other party wishing to make representations at the hearing of the judicial review must file and serve a skeleton argument not less than 14 days before the date of the hearing (or the warned date).\n\n15.7 Not less than 7 days before the date of the hearing (or the warned date), the parties shall file: (a) an agreed list of issues; (b) an agreed chronology of events (with page references to the hearing bundle); and (c) an agreed a list of essential documents for the advance reading of the court (with page references in the hearing bundle to the passages relied on) and a time estimate for that reading.\n\n---\n\nThe hearing bundle and the authorities bundle\n\n16.1 The parties shall agree the contents of a paginated and indexed bundle containing all relevant documents (or extracts from them) required for the hearing of the judicial review (\"the hearing bundle\"). Where the hearing bundle exceeds 400 pages, the parties shall agree the contents of a core bundle. The core bundle shall be paginated and indexed and shall include the pleadings, a copy of the decision and/or measure which is under challenge in the proceedings, and such further documents (or extracts from them) as the parties consider essential for the purposes of the hearing. Each party (or the solicitor acting for each party) shall certify that the hearing bundle and any core bundle meets the requirements of this paragraph.\n\n16.2 An electronic version of the hearing bundle (and any core bundle) shall be prepared in accordance with the Guidance on the Administrative Court website.\n\n16.3 Not less than 21 days before the date of the hearing (or the warned date), the parties shall lodge the hearing bundle (and any core bundle) with the Court in both electronic and hard copy form. For Divisional Court cases the number of hard copy bundles required will be one set for each judge hearing the case.\n\n16.4 The parties shall agree the contents of a bundle containing the authorities to be referred to at the hearing of the judicial review (\"the authorities bundle\").

All information required by the Form must be provided. In particular, the applicant must state the reasons why the application needs to be considered urgently, the reasons why the application was not made sooner, and the timescale within which consideration of the application is requested. The Form must be signed and supported by the required Statement of Truth.\n\n1.3 The applicant must prepare an indexed and paginated bundle (\"the application bundle\") which shall contain the Form N 463 and any other material required by this Practice Direction to be provided as part of the application.

The information provided should be no more than is necessary for the purposes of the application but must cover all matters that it is reasonable to assume a court would consider material to the application.\n\n2.3 The application will be considered in accordance with paragraph 1.8 above.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 54 C - ADMINISTRATIVE COURT (VENUE)\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements Part 54\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nScope and purpose\n\n1.1 This Practice Direction supplements Part 54. It concerns the place in which a claim before the Administrative Court should be started and administered and the venue at which it will be determined. It is intended to facilitate access to justice by enabling cases to be administered and determined in the most appropriate location. To achieve this purpose, it provides flexibility in relation to where claims are to be administered and enables claims to be transferred to different venues.\n\n1.2\n\n(1) The administration of the Administrative Court is organised by geographical area. In addition to the central Administrative Court Office at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, there are Administrative Court Offices in Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds and Manchester. Claims in the area of the Midlands Circuit are administered from (and should be filed in) Birmingham; claims in Wales and on the Western Circuit are administered from (and should be filed in) Cardiff; claims on the North-Eastern Circuit are administered from (and should be filed in) Leeds; and claims on the Northern Circuit are administered from (and should be filed in) Manchester.\n\n(2) The Administrative Court applies the principle that where a claim has a specific connection to a region (by subject matter, location of the claimant or defendant or otherwise) it should, if at all possible, be administered and determined in that region.\n\n1.3 Rule 7.1 A makes specific provision for claims against Welsh public bodies. Such claims are to be issued and heard in Wales unless required otherwise by any enactment, rule or practice direction.\n\n---\n\nVenue - general provisions\n\n2.1 Save where the proceedings are within any of the excepted classes of claim set out in paragraph 3.1 below, proceedings should be commenced at the Administrative Court office for the region with which the claim is most closely connected, having regard to the subject matter of the claim, the location of the claimant, or the defendant, or otherwise: see further below, at paragraph 2.5.\n\n2.2 If a Claim Form which includes one of the excepted classes of claim is filed at an Administrative Court office other than in London, the proceedings will be transferred to London.\n\n2.3 The proceedings may either on application by a party or by the Court acting at its own initiative, be transferred from the Administrative Court Office at which the Claim Form was issued to another Office. Such transfer is a judicial act.\n\n2.4 Once assigned to an Administrative Court Office, the proceedings will be administered from that office and will be determined by a judge of the Administrative Court at a suitable court. For cases assigned to the central Administrative Court Office in London, this will be the Royal Courts of Justice. For cases assigned to any of the other Administrative Court Offices, the choice of court is a matter for the Presiding Judges of the circuit or their delegates.\n\n2.5 The general expectation is that proceedings will be administered and determined in the region with which the claim has the closest connection. This will be determined having regard to the subject matter of the claim, the region in which the claimant resides and the region in which the defendant or any relevant office or department of the defendant is based. In addition, the court may consider any/all other relevant circumstances including the following:\n\n(a) any reason expressed by any party for preferring a particular venue\n\n(b) the ease and cost of travel to a hearing\n\n(c) the availability and suitability of alternative means of attending a hearing (for example, by video-link);\n\n(d) the extent and nature of any public interest that the proceedings be heard in any particular locality;\n\n(e) the time within which it is appropriate for the proceedings to be determined;\n\n(f) whether it is desirable to administer or determine the claim in another region in the light of the volume of claims issued at, and the capacity, resources and workload of, the court at which it is issued;\n\n(g) whether the claim raises issues sufficiently similar to those in another outstanding claim to make it desirable that it should be determined together with, or immediately following, that other claim;\n\n(h) whether the claim raises devolution issues and for that reason whether it should more appropriately be determined in London or Cardiff; and\n\n(i) the region in which the legal representative of the parties are based\n\n2.6 When giving directions underrule 54.10, the court may direct that proceedings be reassigned to another region for hearing (applying the matters referred to in paragraph 2.5). If no such direction is given, the claim will be heard in the same region as that in which the permission application was determined (whether on paper or at a hearing).\n\n---\n\nExcepted classes of claim\n\n3.1 The excepted classes of claim referred to in paragraph 2 are-\n\n(1) proceedings to which Part 76 or Part 79 applies, and for the avoidance of doubt-\n\n(a) proceedings relating to control orders (within the meaning of Part 76);\n\n(b) financial restrictions proceedings (within the meaning of Part 79);\n\n(c) proceedings relating to terrorism or alleged terrorists (where that is a relevant feature of the claim); and\n\n(d) proceedings in which a special advocate is or is to be instructed;\n\n(2) proceedings to which RSC Order 115 applies;\n\n(3) proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002;\n\n(4) appeals to the Administrative Court under the Extradition Act 2003;\n\n(5) proceedings which must be heard by a Divisional Court;\n\n(6) proceedings relating to the discipline of solicitors; and\n\n(7) proceedings under Part 77, Section I (serious crime protection orders).",

and\n\n(d)a witness statement or affidavit giving the name and address of, and the place and date of service on, each person who has been served with the application. If any person who ought to be served has not been served, the witness statement or affidavit must state that fact and the reason why the person was not served.\n\n6.5 An application will be heard-\n\n(a)by a single judge; and\n\n(b)unless the court otherwise orders, not less than 21 days after it was filed at the Administrative Court Office.\n\n6.6 Any person served with the application is entitled to appear and be heard.\n\n6.7 Any respondent who intends to use a witness statement or affidavit at the hearing-\n\n(a)must file it in the Administrative Court Office; and\n\n(b)must serve a copy on the applicant as soon as is practicable and in any event, unless the court otherwise allows, at least 2 days before the hearing.\n\n6.8 The court may allow the applicant to use a further witness statement or affidavit.\n\n6.9 Where on the hearing of an application the court is of the opinion that a person who ought to have been served has not been served, the court may adjourn the hearing, on such terms as it directs, in order that the application may be served on that person.\n\n6.10 Where the court grants permission-\n\n(a)it may impose terms as to costs and as to giving security;\n\n(b)it may give directions; and\n\n(c)the relevant appellant's notice must be served and filed within 7 days of the grant.\n\n6.11 The persons to be served with the appellant's notice are-\n\n(a)the Secretary of State;\n\n(b)the local planning authority who served the notice or gave the decision, as the case may be, or, where the appeal is brought by that authority, the appellant or applicant in the proceedings in which the decision appealed against was given;\n\n(c)in the case of an appeal brought by virtue of section 289(1) of the TCP Act or section 65(1) of the PLBCA Act, any other person having an interest in the land to which the notice relates; and\n\n(d)in the case of an appeal brought by virtue of section 289(2) of the TCP Act, any other person on whom the notice to which those proceedings related was served.\n\n6.12 The appeal will be heard and determined by a single judge unless the court directs that the matter be heard and determined by a Divisional Court.\n\n6.13 The court may remit the matter to the Secretary of State to the extent necessary to enable the Secretary of State to provide the court with such further information in connection with the matter as the court may direct.\n\n6.14 Where the court is of the opinion that the decision appealed against was erroneous in point of law, it will not set aside or vary that decision but will remit the matter to the Secretary of State for re-hearing and determination in accordance with the opinion of the court.\n\n6.15 The court may give directions as to the exercise, until an appeal brought by virtue of section 289(1) of the TCP Act is finally concluded and any re-hearing and determination by the Secretary of State has taken place, of the power to serve, and institute proceedings (including criminal proceedings) concerning-\n\n(a)a stop notice under section 183 of that Act; and\n\n(b)a breach of condition notice under section 187 A of that Act.\n\n6.16 An appeal brought by virtue of sections 289(1) or (2) of the TCP Act or section 65(1) of the PLBCA Act will be treated as if it is a review under statute for the purposes of rules 45.41 to 45.44 and may therefore be an Aarhus Convention claim for the purposes of those rules.",

It applies to claims for environmental review.\n\n1.2 In this Practice Direction the term 'environmental review' has the same meaning as in rule 54.25(2).\n\nSection II - Environmental review\n\nThe Claim Form\n\n2.1(1) The Claim Form must include or be accompanied by the following documents-\n\n(a) a clear and concise statement of the facts relied on set out in numbered paragraphs - \"the Statement of Facts\"; and\n\n(b) a clear and concise statement of the grounds for bringing the claim - \"the Statement of Grounds\". The Statement of Grounds should: identify in separate, numbered paragraphs each ground of challenge; identify the relevant provision or principle of law said to have been breached; and provide sufficient detail of the alleged breach to enable the parties and the court to identify the essential issues alleged to arise. The Statement of Grounds should succinctly explain the claimant's case by reference to the Statement of Facts and state precisely what relief is sought.\n\n(2) The Statement of Facts and the Statement of Grounds may be contained in a single document.\n\n(3) The Statements of Facts and Grounds should be as concise as possible. The two documents together (or the single document if the two are combined) shall not exceed 40 pages. In many cases the court will expect the documents to be significantly shorter than 40 pages. The court may grant permission to exceed the 40-page limit.\n\n2.2 Any application (a) to extend the time limit for filing the Claim Form; and/or (b) for directions in the claim, should be included in or contained in a document that accompanies the Claim Form.\n\n2.3(1) In addition, the Claim Form must be accompanied by-\n\n(a) any written evidence in support of the claim (in this regard, see also rules 8.5(1) and 8.5(7)).\n\n(b) any written evidence in support of any other application contained in the Claim Form;\n\n(c) a copy of any order or decision that the claimant seeks to have quashed;\n\n(d) where the claim relates to a decision of a public authority an approved copy of the reasons for reaching that decision and a copy of any record of the decision under challenge;\n\n(e) copies of any documents on which the claimant proposes to rely;\n\n(f) copies of any relevant statutory material; and\n\n(g) a list of essential documents for advance reading by the court (with page references to the passages relied on).\n\n(2) Where it is not possible to file all the above documents, the claimant must indicate which documents have not been filed and the reasons why they are not currently available.\n\nThe claim bundle\n\n3.1(1) The claimant must prepare a paginated and indexed bundle containing all the documents referred to in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3. An electronic version of the bundle must also be prepared in accordance with the Guidance on the Administrative Court website.\n\n(2) The claimant shall (unless otherwise requested) lodge the bundle with the Court in both electronic and hard copy form. For Divisional Court cases the number of hard copy bundles required will be one set for each judge hearing the case.\n\nDevolution issues\n\n4.1(1) In this Practice Direction \"devolution issue\" has the same meaning as in paragraph 1, Schedule 9 to the Government of Wales Act 2006, paragraph 1, Schedule 10 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998; and paragraph 1, Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998.\n\n(2) Where the claimant intends to raise a devolution issue, the Claim Form must: (a) specify that the claimant wishes to raise a devolution issue and identify the relevant provisions of the Government of Wales Act 2006, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 or the Scotland Act 1998; and (b) contain a summary of the facts, circumstances and points of law on the basis of which it is alleged that a devolution issue arises.\n\nService of Claim Form\n\n5.1 Part 6 contains provisions about the service of Claim Forms.\n\n5.2 Where the defendant or interested party to the claim is the Crown, service of the Claim Form must be effected on the solicitor acting for the relevant government department as if the proceedings were civil proceedings as defined in the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. Practice Direction 66 gives the list published under section 17 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 of the solicitors acting in civil proceedings (as defined in that Act) for the different government departments on whom service is to be effected, and of their addresses.\n\nAcknowledgment of Service and Detailed Grounds\n\n6.1 The Acknowledgment of Service must contain the information specified in rules 8.3(2) and 10.5. See also the requirements set out in Practice Direction 10.\n\n6.2(1) If a defendant or other party chooses to file an Acknowledgement of Service, the Detailed Grounds referred to in CPR 54.32(1)(a) should meet the following requirements.\n\n(2) The Detailed Grounds should identify succinctly any relevant facts. Material matters of factual dispute (if any) should be highlighted.\n\n(3) The Detailed Grounds should (again succinctly) explain the legal basis of that party's response to the claimant's case, by reference to relevant facts.\n\n(4) The Detailed Grounds should be as concise as possible, and shall not exceed 40 pages. The court may grant permission to exceed the 40-page limit.\n\n(5) Where a party filing Detailed Grounds intends to rely on written evidence or on documents not already filed, the party must prepare a paginated and indexed bundle containing that evidence and those documents. An electronic version of the bundle shall also be prepared in accordance with the Guidance on the Administrative Court website.\n\n6.3 The party shall file and serve electronic and hard copy versions of the bundle when filing and serving the Detailed Grounds.\n\nEvidence\n\n7.1 In accordance with the duty of candour, the defendant should, in its Detailed Grounds or evidence, identify any relevant facts, and the reasoning, underlying the matter the subject of the claim for environmental review.\n\n7.2 Disclosure is not required unless the court orders otherwise.\n\n7.3 It will rarely be necessary in an environmental review for the court to hear oral evidence. Any application under rule 8.6(2) for permission to adduce oral evidence or to cross-examine any witness must be made promptly, in accordance with the requirements of Part 23, and be supported by an explanation of why the evidence is necessary for the fair determination of the claim.\n\nRule 54.34-Where Claimant Seeks to Rely upon Additional Grounds\n\n8.1 Where the claimant intends to apply for environmental review on grounds additional to those set out in the Claim Form, the claimant must make an application to the court for permission to amend the Claim Form. The application should be made in accordance with the requirements of Part 23.\n\n8.2 The application must be made promptly and should include, or be accompanied by, a draft of the amended grounds and be supported by evidence explaining the need for the proposed amendment and any delay in making the application for permission to amend.\n\n8.3 The application, the proposed additional grounds and any written evidence, must be served on the defendant and any interested party named in the Claim Form or an Acknowledgement of Service.\n\n8.4 For the purposes of determining an application to rely on additional grounds, rules 17.1 and 17.2 shall apply. Where permission to rely on additional grounds is given, the court may give directions as to amendments to be made to the defendant's Detailed Grounds and/or such other case management directions as appropriate.\n\nRule 54.17 and 54.35-Court's Powers to Hear Any Person\n\n9.1 An application for permission to intervene under rules 54.17 and 54.35 should be made by application in the relevant proceedings, in accordance with the provisions of Part 23.\n\n9.2 Any such application must be made promptly.

The hearing\n\n55.36\n\n(1) At the hearing fixed in accordance with rule 55.34 or at any adjournment of that hearing, the court may-\n\n(a)decide the claim; or\n\n(b)give case management directions.\n\n(2) Where the claim is genuinely disputed on grounds which appear to be substantial, case management directions given under paragraph (1)(b) will include the allocation of the claim to a track or directions to enable it to be allocated.\n\n(3) Except where-\n\n(a)the claim is allocated to the fast track, the intermediate track or the multi-track; or\n\n(b)the court orders otherwise,\n\nany fact that needs to be proved by the evidence of witnesses at a hearing referred to in paragraph (1) may be proved by evidence in writing.\n\n(4) All witness statements must be filed and served at least 2 days before the hearing.\n\n(5) Where the claimant serves the claim form and particulars of claim, the claimant must produce at the hearing a certificate of service of those documents and rule 6.17(2)(a) does not apply. Allocation\n\n55.37\n\n(1) When the court decides the track for a Renting Homes possession claim, the matters it must consider include-\n\n(a)the matters set out in rule 26.13 as modified by the relevant practice direction;\n\n(b)the amount of any arrears of rent;\n\n(c)the importance to the defendant of retaining possession of the dwelling;\n\n(d)the importance of vacant possession to the claimant; and\n\n(e)if applicable, the alleged conduct of the defendant.\n\n(2) The court may only allocate Renting Homes possession claims to the small claims track if all the parties agree.\n\n(3) Where a Renting Homes possession claim has been allocated to the small claims track the claim must be treated, for the purposes of costs, as if it were proceeding on the fast track except that trial costs are to be in the discretion of the court and must not exceed the amount that would be recoverable under Part 45 if the value of the claim were up to £3,000.\n\n(4) Where all the parties agree the court may, when it allocates the claim, order that rule 27.14 (costs on the small claims track) applies and, where it does so, paragraph (3) does not apply.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 55 A - POSSESSION CLAIMS\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements Part 55\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nSECTION I - GENERAL RULES\n\n---\n\n55.3 - STARTING THE CLAIM\n\n1.1\n\n(1) Except where the County Court does not have jurisdiction, possession claims should normally be brought in the County Court. Only exceptional circumstances justify starting a claim in the High Court.\n\n(2) In the County Court, the claim will be issued by the County Court hearing centre where the claim is made, but will then be sent to the County Court hearing centre which serves the address where the land is situated. A claimant shouldconsider the potential delay which may result if a claim is not made at the appropriate hearing centre in the first instance.\n\n1.2 If a claimant starts a claim in the High Court and the court decides that it should have been started in the County Court, the court will normally either strike the claim out or transfer it to the County Court on its own initiative. This is likely to result in delay and the court will normally disallow the costs of starting the claim in the High Court and of any transfer.\n\n1.3 Circumstances which may, in an appropriate case, justify starting a claim in the High Court are if -\n\n(1) there are complicated disputes of fact;\n\n(2) there are points of law of general importance; or\n\n(3) the claim is against trespassers and there is a substantial risk of public disturbance or of serious harm to persons or property which properly require immediate determination.\n\n1.4 The value of the property and the amount of any financial claim may be relevant circumstances, but these factors alone will not normally justify starting the claim in the High Court.\n\n1.5 The claimant must use the appropriate claim form and particulars of claim form. The defence must be in form N 11,N 11 B,N 11 Mor N 11 R, as appropriate.\n\n1.6 High Court claims for the possession of land subject to a mortgage will be assigned to the Chancery Division.\n\n1.7 A claim which is not a possession claim may be brought under the procedure set out in Section I of Part 55 if it is started in the same claim form as a possession claim which, by virtue of rule 55.2(1) must be brought in accordance with that Section.\n\n(Rule 7.3 provides that a claimant may use a single claim form to start all claims which can be conveniently disposed of in the same proceedings)\n\n1.8 For example a claim under paragraphs 4, 5 or 6 of Part I of Schedule 1 to the Mobile Homes Act 1983 may be brought using the procedure set out in Section I of Part 55 if the claim is started in the same claim form as a claim enforcing the rights referred to in section 3(1)(b) of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (which, by virtue of rule 55.2(1) must be brought under Section I of Part 55).\n\n1.9 Where the claim form includes a demotion claim, the claim must be started in the County Court for the district in which the land is situated.\n\n---\n\n55.4 - PARTICULARS OF CLAIM\n\n2.1 In a possession claim the particulars of claim must:\n\n(1) identify the land to which the claim relates;\n\n(2) state whether the claim relates to residential property;\n\n(3) state the ground on which possession is claimed;\n\n(4) give full details about any mortgage or tenancy agreement; and\n\n(5) give details of every person who, to the best of the claimant's knowledge, is in possession of the property.\n\n---\n\nResidential property let on a tenancy\n\n2.2 Paragraphs 2.3 to 2.4 B apply if the claim relates to residential property let on a tenancy.\n\n2.3 If the claim includes a claim for non-payment of rent the particulars of claim must set out:\n\n(1) the amount due at the start of the proceedings;\n\n(2) in schedule form, the dates and amounts of all payments due and payments made under the tenancy agreement for a period of two years immediately preceding the date of issue, or if the first date of default occurred less than two years before the date of issue from the first date of default and a running total of the arrears;\n\n(3) the daily rate of any rent and interest;\n\n(4) any previous steps taken to recover the arrears of rent with full details of any court proceedings; and\n\n(5) any relevant information about the defendant's circumstances, in particular:\n\n(a) whether the defendant is in receipt of social security benefits; and\n\n(b) whether any payments are made on his behalf directly to the claimant under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.\n\n2.3 AIf the claimant wishes to rely on a history of arrears which is longer than two years, he should state this in his particulars and exhibit a full (or longer) schedule to a witness statement.\n\n2.4 If the claimant knows of any person (including a mortgagee) entitled to claim relief against forfeiture as underlessee under section 146(4) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (or in accordance with section 38 of the Senior Courts Act 1981, or section 138(9 C) of the County Courts Act 1984):\n\n(1) the particulars of claim must state the name and address of that person; and\n\n(2) the claimant must file a copy of the particulars of claim for service on him.\n\n2.4 AIf the claim for possession relates to the conduct of the tenant, the particulars of claim must state details of the conduct alleged.\n\n2.4 BIf the possession claim relies on a statutory ground or grounds for possession, the particulars of claim must specify the ground or grounds relied on.\n\n---\n\nLand subject to a mortgage\n\n2.5 If the claim is a possession claim by a mortgagee, the particulars of claim must also set out:\n\n(1) if the claim relates to residential property whether:\n\n(a) a land charge of Class F has been registered under section 2(7) of the Matrimonial Homes Act 1967;\n\n(b) a notice registered under section 2(8) or 8(3) of the Matrimonial Homes Act 1983 has been entered and on whose behalf;

The court will keep a record, by electronic or other means, of when online defence forms are received.\n\n---\n\nStatement of truth\n\n8.1 CPR Part 22 requires any statement of case to be verified by a statement of truth. This applies to any online claims and defences and application notices.\n\n8.2 CPR Part 22 also requires that if an applicant wishes to rely on matters set out in his application notice as evidence, the application notice must be verified by a statement of truth. This applies to any application notice completed online that contains matters on which the applicant wishes to rely as evidence.\n\n8.3 Attention is drawn to -\n\n(1) paragraph 2 of Practice Direction 22, which stipulates the form of the statement of truth; and\n\n(2) rule 22.1(6) and paragraph 3 of Practice Direction 22, which provides who may sign a statement of truth; and\n\n(3) CPR 32.14, which sets out the consequences of making, or causing to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth, without an honest belief in its truth.\n\n---\n\nSignature\n\n9.1 Any provision of the CPR which requires a document to be signed by any person is satisfied by that person entering his name on an online form.\n\n---\n\nCommunication with the court electronically by the messaging service\n\n10.1 If the PCOL website specifies that a court accepts electronic communications relating to claims brought using Possession Claims Online the parties may communicate with the court using the messaging service facility, available on the PCOL website ('the messaging service').\n\n10.2 The messaging service is for brief and straightforward communications only. The PCOL website contains a list of examples of when it will not be appropriate to use the messaging service.\n\n10.3 Parties must not send to the court forms or attachments via the messaging service.\n\n10.4 The court shall treat any forms or attachments sent via the messaging service as not having been filed or received.\n\n10.5 The court will normally reply via the messaging service where -\n\n(1) the response is to a message transmitted via the messaging service; and\n\n(2) the sender has provided an e-mail address.\n\n---\n\nElectronic applications\n\n11.1 Certain applications in relation to a possession claim or Renting Homes possession claim started online may be made electronically ('online applications').

    "content": "Document: Practice Direction 56\nPart 1 of 2\n==================================================\nPRACTICE DIRECTION 56 - LANDLORD AND TENANT CLAIMS AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS ABOUT LAND\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements Part 56\n\nContents of this Practice Direction SECTION I - LANDLORD AND TENANT CLAIMS\n\n1.1 In this section of this practice direction -\n\n(1) 'the 1927 Act' means the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927;\n\n(2) 'the 1954 Act' means the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954;\n\n(3) 'the 1985 Act' means the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985; and\n\n(4) 'the 1987 Act' means the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. 56.2 - STARTING THE CLAIM\n\n2.1 Subject to paragraph 2.1 A, the claimant in a landlord and tenant claim must use the Part 8 procedure as modified by Part 56 and this practice direction.\n\n2.1 AWhere the landlord and tenant claim is a claim for -\n\n(1) a new tenancy under section 24 of the 1954 Act in circumstances where the grant of a new tenancy is opposed; or\n\n(2) the termination of a tenancy under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act,\n\nthe claimant must use the Part 7 procedure as modified by Part 56 and this practice direction.\n\n2.2\n\n(1) Except where the county court does not have jurisdiction , landlord and tenant claims should normally be brought in the county court. Only exceptional circumstances justify starting a claim in the High Court.\n\n(2) In the County Court, the claim will be issued by the County Court hearing centre where the claim is made and will then be sent to the County Court hearing centre which serves the address where the land is situated. A claimant should consider the potential delay which may result if a claim is not sent to the appropriate County Court hearing centre in the first instance.\n\n2.3 If a claimant starts a claim in the High Court and the court decides that it should have been started in the county court, the court will normally either strike the claim out or transfer it to the county court on its own initiative. This is likely to result in delay and the court will normally disallow the costs of starting the claim in the High Court and of any transfer.\n\n2.4 Circumstances which may, in an appropriate case, justify starting a claim in the High Court are if -\n\n(1) there are complicated disputes of fact; or\n\n(2) there are points of law of general importance.\n\n2.5 The value of the property and the amount of any financial claim may be relevant circumstances, but these factors alone will not normally justify starting the claim in the High Court.\n\n2.6 A landlord and tenant claim started in the High Court must be brought in the Chancery Division.\n\n(Where the tenant is a tied pub tenant of a pub-owning business under the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, the procedure provided by paragraphs 3.1 to 3.19 of this practice direction is modified by paragraphs 3.20 to 3.32.) Claims for a new tenancy under section 24 and termination of a tenancy under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act\n\n3.1 This paragraph applies to a claim for a new tenancy under section 24 and termination of a tenancy under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act where rule 56.3 applies and in this paragraph -\n\n(1) 'an unopposed claim' means a claim for a new tenancy under section 24 of the 1954 Act in circumstances where the grant of a new tenancy is not opposed;\n\n(2) 'an opposed claim' means a claim for -\n\n(a) a new tenancy under section 24 of the 1954 Act in circumstances where the grant of a new tenancy is opposed; or\n\n(b) the termination of a tenancy under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act; and\n\n(3) 'grounds of opposition' means -\n\n(a) the grounds specified in section 30(1) of the 1954 Act on which a landlord may oppose an application for a new tenancy under section 24(1) of the 1954 Act or make an application under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act; or\n\n(b) any other basis on which the landlord asserts that a new tenancy ought not to be granted. Precedence of claim forms where there is more than one application to the court under section 24(1) or section 29(2) of the 1954 Act\n\n3.2 Where more than one application to the court under section 24(1) or section 29(2) of the 1954 Act is made, the following provisions shall apply -\n\n(1) once an application to the court under section 24(1) of the 1954 Act has been served on a defendant, no further application to the court in respect of the same tenancy whether under section 24(1) or section 29(2) of the 1954 Act may be served by that defendant without the permission of the court;\n\n(2) if more than one application to the court under section 24(1) of the 1954 Act in respect of the same tenancy is served on the same day, any landlord's application shall stand stayed until further order of the court;\n\n(3) if applications to the court under both section 24(1) and section 29(2) of the 1954 Act in respect of the same tenancy are served on the same day, any tenant's application shall stand stayed until further order of the court; and\n\n(4) if a defendant is served with an application under section 29(2) of the 1954 Act ('the section 29(2) application') which was issued at a time when an application to the court had already been made by that defendant in respect of the same tenancy under section 24(1) of the 1954 Act ('the section 24(1) application'), the service of the section 29(2) application shall be deemed to be a notice under rule 7.7 requiring service or discontinuance of the section 24(1) application within a period of 14 days after the service of the section 29(2) application. Defendant where the claimant is the tenant making a claim for a new tenancy under section 24 of the 1954 Act\n\n3.3 Where a claim for a new tenancy under section 24 of the 1954 Act is made by a tenant, the person who, in relation to the claimant's current tenancy, is the landlord as defined in section 44 of the 1954 Act must be a defendant.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 56 A - RENTING HOMES (WALES) CLAIMS\n\n---\n\nThis practice direction supplements CPR Part 56\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1 In addition to any relevant definitions in Part 56, particularly those in rule 56.5, which all apply to this practice direction in any event, terms defined in the 2016 Act have the same meaning in this practice direction.\n\n1.2 This practice direction makes provision for the bringing of Renting Homes (Wales) claims. Where a claim for possession, the making of a prohibited conduct standard contract order, or a claim for damages for disrepair is made at the commencement of proceedings Section III of Part 56 does not apply and the procedure for those particular claims should be followed.\n\n---\n\nStarting the claim\n\n2.1(1) \"Permission to make an out of time application\" means an application for permission to make an application out of time under the following provisions of the 2016 Act -\n\n(a)section 14(4);\n\n(b)paragraph 16(4) of Schedule 2;\n\n(c)paragraph 5(4) of Schedule 4; or\n\n(d)paragraph 6(4) of Schedule 7.\n\n(2) Where permission to make an out of time application is sought before the substantive application is made, it should be sought by written request.\n\n(3) Where permission to make an out of time application is sought at the same time as the substantive application is made it should be sought as part of substantive claim using the procedure appropriate for that claim.\n\n2.2 Renting Homes (Wales) claims should normally be brought in the county court. Only exceptional circumstances justify starting a claim in the High Court even if the High Court has jurisdiction.\n\n2.3 If a claimant starts a claim in the High Court and the court decides that it should have been started in the County Court, the court will normally either strike the claim out or transfer it to the County Court on its own initiative. This is likely to result in delay and the court will normally disallow the costs of starting the claim in the High Court and of any transfer.\n\n2.4 Circumstances which may, in an appropriate case, justify starting a claim in the High Court are if -\n\n(a) there are complicated disputes of fact; or\n\n(b) there are points of law of general importance.\n\n2.5 The value of the property and the amount of any financial claim may be relevant circumstances, but these factors alone will not normally justify starting the claim in the High Court.\n\n2.6 A Renting Homes (Wales) claim started in the High Court must be brought in the Chancery Division.\n\n---\n\nContents of the claim form in all cases\n\n3.1 The claim form must contain details of -\n\n(a )the dwelling to which the claim relates;\n\n(b) the particulars of the current occupation contract (including date, parties and duration) insofar as the claimant is able to confirm the same;\n\n(c) any notice relevant to the claim;\n\n(d) the provisions of the 2016 Act under which the claim is brought.\n\n---\n\nParticular Renting Homes (Wales) claims\n\nApplication under section 14(2) of the 2016 Act (review of the landlord's decision to give notice of standard contract)\n\n4.1 The evidence in support of the Renting Homes (Wales) claim must include a copy of the notice given by the landlord under section 13 of the 2016 Act.\n\nApplications under sections 34, 36 and 37 of the 2016 Act (application for declaration about an occupation contract: missing, incomplete or incorrect contract terms)\n\n4.2 The claim form or evidence in support of the Renting Homes (Wales) claim must give details of any fundamental or supplementary provision which the claimant claims was not incorporated into the occupation contract or was incorporated with modification and identify such modifications.\n\nApplication under section 44 of the 2016 Act (application for order to return security)\n\n4.3 The claim form must give details of the security that has been given and the person who appears to be holding the property constituting that security.\n\nApplication under section 66 of the 2016 Act (application by sub-holder to end contract-holder's occupation contract)\n\n4.4 The claim form must give details of the landlord and the evidence in support of the Renting Homes (Wales) claim must include a copy of the notice given under section 66(3) of the 2016 Act and proof that such notice was given to both the contract-holder and to the contract-holder's landlord.\n\nAppeal under section 78 of the 2016 Act (appeal as to who is to succeed to an occupation contract)\n\n4.5 The claim form must give details of all relevant successors and any reasons given by the landlord for the selection made by the landlord.\n\nApplication under section 85 of the 2016 Act (application for declaration or order about a landlord's refusal, or conditions of, giving consent)\n\n4.6 The claim form must give details of the request for consent and the evidence in support of the Renting Homes (Wales) claim must include the landlord's written statement giving reasons for refusing consent or consenting subject to conditions.\n\nApplication under section 87 of the 2016 Act (compensation for failure relating to provision of written statements)\n\n4.7 Where a Renting Homes (Wales) claim is made for compensation under section 87 of the 2016 Act whether on its own or in combination with other claims under the 2016 Act the proceedings should normally be commenced under Part 7. The claim form must provide details of the rent payable under the occupation contract and the amount of compensation claimed.\n\nApplication under section 140 of the 2016 Act (application for order requiring a joint contract-holder to join a transfer)\n\n4.8 The evidence in support of such a Renting Homes (Wales) claim must include a copy of the occupation contract or give full details of the terms relied upon and the reasons why a copy of the contract cannot be provided.\n\nClaim under section 208 of the 2016 Act (claim for misrepresentation or concealment of facts used to obtain order for possession)\n\n4.9 If the Renting Homes (Wales) claim for compensation is not made in the original proceedings the claim should normally be commenced under Part 7.\n\nApplication under sections 222, 226 and 228 of the 2016 Act (remedies against the landlord: order or declaration of the court)\n\n4.10 The claim form must give details of the grounds on which the claimant relies and the evidence in support of the Renting Homes (Wales) claim must include copies of any notices given to the contract-holder under sections 220, 225 or 227 of the 2016 Act.\n\nApplication under paragraph 16 of Schedule 2 of the 2016 Act (review of decision to extend the period of a licence or tenancy that is not an occupation contract)\n\n4.11 The evidence in support of the Renting Homes (Wales) claim for a review must include a copy of the landlord's notice of extension.\n\nApplication under paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 of the 2016 Act (review of decision to confirm extension of introductory period)\n\n4.12 The evidence in support of the Renting Homes (Wales) claim for a review must include copies of the landlord's notice of extension of the introductory period and the landlord's notice after review confirming their decision to give a notice of extension of the introductory period.\n\nApplication under paragraphs 2 or 3 of Schedule 5 of the 2016 Act (applications in relation to deposit schemes)\n\n4.13 The Renting Homes (Wales) claim should normally be commenced under Part 7 and the particulars of claim must confirm -\n\n(a)t he amount of the deposit paid; and\n\n(b) the ground or grounds on which the application is made.\n\nApplication under paragraph 6 of Schedule 7 of the 2016 Act (review of decision to extend probation period)\n\n4.14 The evidence in support of the Renting Homes (Wales) claim for a review must include copies of the landlord's notice of extension of the probation period and the landlord's notice after review confirming their decision to give a notice of extension of the probation period.\n\nApplication under paragraph 7 of Schedule 7 of the 2016 Act (application for order to end a probation period early)\n\n4.15 The claim form must identify the ground or grounds on which the Renting Homes (Wales) claim is made. The evidence in support of such application must include a copy of the order made under section 116 of the 2016 Act imposing the periodic standard contract and confirm that the landlord had not made an appropriate programme of social support available to the contract-holder and that it is unlikely that such support will be made available if paragraph 7(3)(b) of Schedule 7 of the 2016 Act is relied upon.",

Paragraph 8 of this practice direction makes provision about an application for such a grant.)\n\n---\n\nTestamentary documents and evidence about testamentary documents\n\n3.1\n\nUnless the court orders otherwise, if a testamentary document is held by the court (whether it was lodged by a party or it was previously held at a probate registry) when the claim has been disposed of the court will send it to the Leeds District Probate Registry.\n\n---\n\n3.2\n\nThe written evidence about testamentary documents required by this Part -\n\n(1) should be in the form annexed to this practice direction; and\n\n(2) must be signed by the party personally and not by his solicitor or other representative (except that if the party is a child or protected party the written evidence must be signed by his litigation friend).\n\n---\n\n3.3\n\nIn a case in which there is urgent need to commence a probate claim (for example, in order to be able to apply immediately for the appointment of an administrator pending the determination of the claim) and it is not possible for the claimant to lodge the testamentary documents or to file the evidence about testamentary documents in the relevant office at the same time as the claim form is to be issued, the court may direct that the claimant shall be allowed to issue the claim form upon his giving an undertaking to the court to lodge the documents and file the evidence within such time as the court shall specify.\n\n---\n\nCase management\n\nIn giving case management directions in a probate claim the court will give consideration to the questions -\n\n(1) whether any person who may be affected by the claim and who is not joined as a party should be joined as a party or given notice of the claim, whether under rule 19.8 A or otherwise; and\n\n(2) whether to make a representation order under rule 19.6 or rule 19.7.\n\nSummary judgment\n\n---\n\n5.1\n\nIf an order pronouncing for a will in solemn form is sought on an application for summary judgment, the evidence in support of the application must include written evidence proving due execution of the will.\n\n---\n\n5.2\n\nIf a defendant has given notice in his defence under rule 57.7(5) that he raises no positive case but -\n\n(1) he insists that the will be proved in solemn form; and\n\n(2) for that purpose he will cross-examine the witnesses who attested the will;\n\nany application by the claimant for summary judgment is subject to the right of that defendant to require those witnesses to attend court for cross-examination.\n\nSettlement of a probate claim\n\n---\n\n6.1\n\nIf at any time the parties agree to settle a probate claim, the court may -\n\n(1) order the trial of the claim on written evidence, which will lead to a grant in solemn form;\n\n(2) order that the claim be discontinued or dismissed under rule 57.11, which will lead to a grant in common form; or\n\n(3) pronounce for or against the validity of one or more wills under section 49 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985.\n\n(For a form of order which is also applicable to discontinuance and which may be adapted as appropriate, see Practice Form No. CH 38)\n\n(Section 49 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985 permits a probate claim to be compromised without a trial if every 'relevant beneficiary', as defined in that section, has consented to the proposed order. It is only available in the High Court.)\n\n---\n\n6.2\n\nApplications under section 49 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985 may be heard by a master or district judge and must be supported by written evidence identifying the relevant beneficiaries and exhibiting the written consent of each of them. The written evidence of testamentary documents required by rule 57.5 will still be necessary.\n\nApplication for an order to bring in a will, etc.\n\n---\n\n7.1\n\nAny party applying for an order under section 122 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 ('the 1981 Act') must serve the application notice on the person against whom the order is sought.\n\n(Section 122 of the 1981 Act empowers the court to order a person to attend court for examination, and to answer questions and bring in documents, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that such person has knowledge of a testamentary document. Rule 50(1) of the Non-Contentious Probate Rules 1987 makes similar provision where a probate claim has not been commenced.)\n\n---\n\n7.2\n\nAn application for the issue of a witness summons under section 123 of the 1981 Act -\n\n(1) may be made without notice; and\n\n(2) must be supported by written evidence setting out the grounds of the application.\n\n(Section 123 of the 1981 Act empowers the court, where it appears that any person has in his possession, custody or power a testamentary document, to issue a witness summons ordering such person to bring in that document. Rule 50(2) of the Non-Contentious Probate Rules makes similar provision where a probate claim has not been commenced.)\n\n---\n\n7.3\n\nAn application under section 122 or 123 of the 1981 Act should be made to a master or district judge.\n\n7.4\n\nA person against whom a witness summons is issued under section 123 of the 1981 Act who denies that the testamentary document referred to in the witness summons is in his possession or under his control may file written evidence to that effect.\n\nAdministration pending the determination of a probate claim\n\n---\n\n8.1\n\nAn application under section 117 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 for an order for the grant of administration pending the determination of a probate claim should be made by application notice in the probate claim.\n\n---\n\n8.2\n\nIf an order for a grant of administration is made under section 117 of the 1981 Act -\n\n(1) Rules 69.4 to 69.7 shall apply as if the administrator were a receiver appointed by the court;\n\n(2) if the court allows the administrator remuneration under rule 69.7, it may make an order under section 117(3) of the 1981 Act assigning the remuneration out of the estate of the deceased; and\n\n(3) every application relating to the conduct of the administration shall be made by application notice in the probate claim.\n\n---\n\n8.3\n\nAn order under section 117 may be made by a master or district judge.\n\n8.4\n\nIf an order is made under section 117 an application for the grant of letters of administration should be made to the Principal Registry of the Family Division, First Avenue House, 42-49 High Holborn, London WC 1 V 6 NP.\n\n---\n\n8.5\n\nThe appointment of an administrator to whom letters of administration are granted following an order under section 117 will cease automatically when a final order in the probate claim is made but will continue pending any appeal.\n\nII RECTIFICATION OF WILLS\n\nScope of this Section\n\nThis Section of this practice direction applies to claims for the rectification of a will.\n\nLodging the grant\n\n---\n\n10.1\n\nIf the claimant is the person to whom the grant was made in respect of the will of which rectification is sought, he must, unless the court orders otherwise, lodge the probate or letters of administration with the will annexed with the court when the claim form is issued.\n\n---\n\n10.2\n\nIf a defendant has the probate or letters of administration in his possession or under his control, he must, unless the court orders otherwise, lodge it in the relevant office within 14 days after the service of the claim form on him.\n\nOrders\n\n---\n\n11.\n\nA copy of every order made for the rectification of a will shall be sent to the Principal Registry of the Family Division for filing, and a memorandum of the order shall be endorsed on, or permanently annexed to, the grant under which the estate is administered.\n\nIII SUBSTITUTION AND REMOVAL OF PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES\n\nScope of this Section\n\n---\n\n12.\n\nThis Section of this practice direction applies to claims and applications for substitution or removal of a personal representative. If substitution or removal of a personal representative is sought by application in existing proceedings, this Section shall apply with references to the claim, claim form and claimant being read as if they referred to the application, application notice and applicant respectively.\n\nStarting the claim\n\n---\n\n13.1\n\nThe claim form must be accompanied by -\n\n(1) either -\n\n(a) a sealed or certified copy of the grant of probate or letters of administration, or\n\n(b) where the claim is to substitute or remove an executor and is made before a grant of probate has been issued, the original or, if the original is not available, a copy of the will; and\n\n(2) written evidence containing the grounds of the claim and the following information so far as it is known to the claimant -\n\n(a) brief details of the property comprised in the estate, with an approximate estimate of its capital value and any income that is received from it;\n\n(b) brief details of the liabilities of the estate;\n\n(c) the names and addresses of the persons who are in possession of the documents relating to the estate;\n\n(d) the names of the beneficiaries and their respective interests in the estate; and\n\n(e) the name, address and occupation of any proposed substituted personal representative.\n\n---\n\n13.2\n\nIf the claim is for the appointment of a substituted personal representative, the claim form must be accompanied by -\n\n(1) a signed or (in the case of the Public Trustee or a corporation) sealed consent to act; and\n\n(2) written evidence as to the fitness of the proposed substituted personal representative, if an individual, to act.\n\nProduction of the grant\n\n---\n\n14.1\n\nOn the hearing of the claim the personal representative must produce to the Court the grant of representation to the deceased's estate.\n\n14.2\n\nIf an order is made substituting or removing the personal representative, the grant (together with a sealed copy of the order) must be sent to and remain in the custody of the Principal Registry of the Family Division until a memorandum of the order has been endorsed on or permanently annexed to the grant.\n\n---\n\n14.3\n\nWhere the claim is to substitute or remove an executor and the claim is made before a grant of probate has been issued, paragraphs 14.1 and 14.2 do not apply. Where in such a case an order is made substituting or removing an executor a sealed copy of the order must be sent to the Principal Registry of the Family Division where it will be recorded and retained pending any application for a grant. An order sent to the Principal Registry in accordance with this paragraph must be accompanied by a note of the full name and date of death of the deceased, if it is not apparent on the face of the order.\n\n---\n\nIV CLAIMS UNDER THE INHERITANCE (PROVISION FOR FAMILY AND DEPENDANTS) ACT 1975\n\nAcknowledgment of service by personal representative - rule 57.16(4)\n\n15.\n\nWhere a defendant who is a personal representative wishes to remain neutral in relation to the claim, and agrees to abide by any decision which the court may make, he should state this in Section A of the acknowledgment of service form.\n\nWritten evidence of personal representative - rule 57.16(5)\n\n---\n\n16.\n\nThe written evidence filed by a defendant who is a personal representative must state to the best of that person's ability -\n\n(1) full details of the value of the deceased's net estate, as defined in section 25(1) of the Act;\n\n(2) the person or classes of persons beneficially interested in the estate, and -\n\n(a) the names and (unless they are parties to the claim) addresses of all living beneficiaries; and\n\n(b) the value of their interests in the estate so far as they are known.\n\n(3) whether any living beneficiary (and if so, naming him) is a child or a person who lacks capacity (within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act 2005); and\n\n(4) any facts which might affect the exercise of the court's powers under the Act.\n\n---\n\nSeparate representation of claimants\n\n17.\n\nIf a claim is made jointly by two or more claimants, and it later appears that any of the claimants have a conflict of interests -\n\n(1) any claimant may choose to be represented at any hearing by separate solicitors or counsel, or may appear in person; and\n\n(2) if the court considers that claimants who are represented by the same solicitors or counsel ought to be separately represented, it may adjourn the application until they are.\n\n---\n\nProduction of the grant\n\n18.1\n\nOn the hearing of a claim the personal representative must produce to the court the original grant of representation to the deceased's estate.\n\n18.2\n\nIf the court makes an order under the Act, the original grant (together with a sealed copy of the order) must be sent to the Principal Registry of the Family Division for a memorandum of the order to be endorsed on or permanently annexed to the grant in accordance with section 19(3) of the Act.\n\n---\n\n18.3\n\nEvery final order embodying terms of compromise made in proceedings under the Act, whether made with or without a hearing, must contain a direction that a memorandum of the order shall be endorsed on or permanently annexed to the probate or letters of administration and a copy of the order shall be sent to the Principal Registry of the Family Division with the relevant grant of probate or letters of administration for endorsement.\n\nANNEX\n\n---\n\nA form of witness statement or affidavit about testamentary documents\n\n---\n\n(CPR rule 57.5)\n\n(Title of the claim)\n\nI [name and address] the claimant/defendant in this claim state [on oath] that I have no knowledge of any document -\n\n(i) being or purported to be or having the form or effect of a will or codicil of [name of deceased] whose estate is the subject of this claim;\n\n(ii) being or purporting to be a draft or written instructions for any such will or codicil made by or at the request of or under the instructions of the deceased;\n\n(iii) being or purporting to be evidence of the contents or a copy of any such will or codicil which is alleged to have been lost or destroyed,\n\nexcept … [describe any testamentary document of the deceased, and if any such document is not in your control, give the name and address of the person who you believe has possession or control of it, or state that you do not know the name and address of that person] …\n\n[I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true.

Those Business and Property Courts in the District Registries of the High Court in Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, and Cardiff, are, respectively, described as the Business and Property Courts in Birmingham, the Business and Property Courts in Bristol, the Business and Property Courts in Leeds, the Business and Property Courts in Liverpool, the Business and Property Courts in Manchester, the Business and Property Courts in Newcastle and the Business and Property Courts in Wales. In this Practice Direction the Business and Property Courts in Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Cardiff are referred to together as the B&PCs District Registries.\n\n1.3 The work of the Business and Property Courts is divided and listed into the following courts or lists: the Admiralty Court, the Business List, the Commercial Court, the Circuit Commercial Courts, the Competition List, the Financial List, the Insolvency and Companies List, the Intellectual Property List, the Property, Trusts and Probate List, the Revenue List, and the Technology and Construction Court.\n\n1.4 The courts or lists of the Business and Property Courts include sub-lists, as follows:\n\n(1)The Pensions sub-list and Financial Services and Regulatory sub-list are sub-lists of the Business List;\n\n(2)The Patents Court and the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court are sub-lists of the Intellectual Property List.\n\n1.5\n\n(1) The Business and Property Courts operate within and are subject to all statutory provisions and rules together with all procedural rules and practice directions applicable to the proceedings concerned.\n\n(2) In particular, the following provisions of the CPR apply-\n\nPart 49 (Companies Court)Part 57 (Probate, Inheritance and Presumption of Death)Part 58 (Commercial Court)Part 59 (Circuit Commercial Courts)Part 60 (Technology and Construction Court Claims)Part 61 (Admiralty Claims)Part 62 (Arbitration Claims)Part 63 (Intellectual Property Claims)Part 63 A (Financial List)Part 64 (Estates, Trusts and Charities)Practice Direction - Insolvency Proceedings Practice Direction: Directors Disqualification Proceedings Practice Direction PD 51 O (Electronic Working)EU Competition Law Practice Direction\n\n1.6 This Practice Direction applies to cases in the Business and Property Courts or cases which are to be issued in those courts. In the event of inconsistency between this Practice Direction and any other Practice Direction the provisions of this Practice Direction shall prevail.\n\n1.7 Parties will also need to give careful consideration to the Chancery Guide, the Admiralty and Commercial Courts Guide, the Technology and Construction Court Guide, the Financial List Guide, the Circuit Commercial Court Guide, the Patents Court Guide, and the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court Guide (where applicable).\n\n---\n\nStarting proceedings\n\n2.1 Starting proceedings in the Business and Property Courts is subject to CPR Parts 7 and 8.\n\n2.2\n\n(1) A claimant wishing to issue a claim in the Business and Property Courts chooses which court, list or sub-list from within the Business and Property Courts in which to issue its claim, based (subject to sub-paragraph (2)) on the principal subject matter of the dispute.(The courts, lists and sub-lists are set out in paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4.)\n\n(2) In cases where different aspects of the dispute indicate that the case be issued in different lists, sub-lists or courts, the claimant must consider whether there are aspects requiring the expertise of a specialist judge and choose the list, sub-list or court in which the relevant specialist judges sit.\n\n2.3\n\n(1) Before a claimant issues a claim in the Business and Property Courts, the claimant must determine the appropriate location in which to issue the claim.\n\n(2) With the exception of claims started under Parts 58, 60, 61 and 62, claims which are intended to be issued in the Business and Property Courts and which have significant links to a particular circuit outside London or anywhere else in the South Eastern Circuit must be issued in the B&PCs District Registry located in the circuit in question. If a claim has significant links with more than one circuit, the claim should be issued in the location with which the claim has the most significant links.\n\n(3) A link to a particular circuit is established where-\n\n(a) one or more of the parties has its address or registered office in the circuit in question (with extra weight given to the address of any non-represented parties);\n\n(b) at least one of the witnesses expected to give oral evidence at trial or other hearing is located in the circuit;\n\n(c) the dispute occurred in a location within the circuit;\n\n(d) the dispute concerns land, goods or other assets located in the circuit; or\n\n(e) the parties' legal representatives are based in the circuit.\n\n(4) A claim which raises significant questions of fact or law in common with another claim already proceeding before a B&PCs District Registry may be regarded as having significant links with the circuit in question.\n\n2.4\n\n(1) In a claim issued in London in the following courts, a hearing may, where appropriate, take place in a court in a circuit-\n\n(a) the Commercial Court;(b) the Admiralty Court;(c) the Financial List;(c) the Technology and Construction Court.\n\n(2) A judge of the Commercial Court may, where appropriate and subject always to available judicial resources, be made available to hear a claim issued in a Circuit Commercial Court.\n\n2.5 While any appropriate claim may be issued in any of the B&PCs District Registries, the following are circumstances in which case management or trial may instead occur in the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales-\n\n(1) Where a claim is issued in the Revenue List in one of the B&PCs District Registries, HM Revenue and Customs may nevertheless seek to have the proceedings case managed and/or tried in the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales, in accordance with CPR 30.3(2)(h) and Annex 1 of Practice Direction 66.(2) A claim meeting the definition established in paragraph 1.1 of the EU Competition Law Practice Direction may be issued in an appropriate BPCs District Registry, but its case management and/or trial in the district registry in question will be dependent on an appropriate judge being made available in the district registry in question.(3) A claim in the Intellectual Property List, which includes the Patents Court and the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court (\"IPEC\") (and includes the IPEC small claims track to which rule 63.27 applies), may be issued in an appropriate BPCs District Registry. However the case management and/or trial of a claim in the Patents Court or the IPEC in the BPCs District Registry in question will be dependent on an appropriate judge being made available in the district registry in question.\n\n---\n\nTransfers\n\n3.1\n\n(1) Subject to CPR 30.2, 30.5 and 59.3, the Business and Property Courts may, having regard to the criteria in 3.1(3), order proceedings in the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales or of a BPCs District Registry, or any part of such proceedings (such as a counterclaim or an application made in the proceedings), to be transferred-\n\n(a) from the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales to the Business and Property Courts in a BPCs District Registry; or(b) from the Business and Property Courts in a BPCs District Registry to the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales or to the Business and Property Courts in another BPCs District Registry.\n\n(2) An application for an order under paragraph 1(b) must be made to the Business and Property Court from which the transfer is sought, and notified to the intended receiving Business and Property Court at the same time by the applicant, and must be consented to by the receiving Business and Property Court before any order for transfer is made.\n\n(3) When considering whether to make an order under rule 30.2(4) (transfer between the Royal Courts of Justice and the district registries) when the proceedings are in the Business and Property Courts, the court must also have regard to-\n\n(a) significant links between the claim and the circuit in question, considering the factors listed in paragraph 2.3(3) and (4) above;(b) whether court resources, deployment constraints, or fairness require that the hearings (including the trial) be held in another court than the court into which it was issued;(c) the wishes of the parties, which bear special weight in the decision but may not be determinative;(d) the international nature of the case, with the understanding that international cases may be more suitable for trial in centres with international transport links;(e) the availability of a judge specialising in the type of claim in question to sit in the court to which the claim is being transferred.\n\n3.2 In addition to the provisions set out in CPR 30.3, the Business and Property Courts must have regard, when considering whether to make an order for transfer from the Business and Property Courts to a county court hearing centre:\n\n(a) to the nature of the claim, in accordance with the guidance provided at paragraphs 4.1 to 4.4; and,(b) to the availability of a judge specialising in the corresponding type of claim to sit in an appropriate court in the circuit;\n\n3.3 When considering the availability of a judge under paragraph 3.1(e), the listing office of the court to which the claim is being transferred will be consulted before the order is made by the court.\n\n---\n\nSpecialist work in the County Court\n\n4.1 Subject to any enactment or rule relating to the jurisdiction of the County Court, the County Court at Central London, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, and Preston are appropriate venues for any cases which are suitable to be heard in the County Court which fall within the definition in paragraph 4.2 as the specialist work of the type undertaken in the Business and Property Courts.\n\n4.2 The specialist work of the type undertaken in the Business and Property Courts includes all the work that falls under the jurisdiction of the courts and lists that make up the Business and Property Courts, except for-\n\n(a) Claims for possession of domestic property and rent and mesne profits, or in respect of domestic mortgages;(b) Claims for possession of commercial premises or disputes arising out of business tenancies that are routine in nature;(c) Claims falling under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, unless combined with other specialist claims;(d) Hearings of applications to set aside statutory demands, unopposed creditors' winding-up petitions or unopposed bankruptcy petitions;(e) Building claims, other than adjudication claims, of a value under £75,000;(f) Invoice and other straightforward business claims of a value under £75,000;(g) Boundary and easement disputes involving no conveyancing issues;(h) Claims to enforce a charging order;(i) Applications under the Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992;(j) Proceedings under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975.\n\n4.3 Claims issued in the County Court which are issued in the County Court at the hearing centres defined in paragraph 4.1 and relate to the specialist work of the type undertaken in the Business and Property Courts will be marked \"Business and Property work\" by the court upon allocation if they have not already been marked in that way by the claimant, and will be managed and heard only by judges specialising in this work.\n\n4.4 Judges specialising in the County Court Business and Property work must spend a minimum of 20 percent of their time handling Business and Property work, either in the Business and Property Courts or in the County Court.\n\n---\n\nAppeals in BPCs District Registries\n\n5.1 Specific appeal slots will be created in listing in the BPCs District Registries to accommodate blocks of applications for permission to appeal and appeals which are to be heard by a Group A judge (as defined in PD 52 A) in accordance with PD 52 A.\n\n5.2 So far as possible these slots will be concomitant with the slots identified for cases listed in BPCs District Registries requiring a Group A judge as defined in PD 52 A to hear them and transferred cases referred to in paragraph 3.",

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 57 AB - SHORTER AND FLEXIBLE TRIALS SCHEMES\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements CPR Part 57 A\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\n1. General\n\n1.1 This Practice Direction provides for two schemes, the Shorter Trials Scheme and the Flexible Trials Scheme.\n\n1.2 The schemes will-\n\n(a) operate from 1 October 2018;\n\n(b) operate in all the Business and Property Courts including those in the Rolls Building and those situated outside London;\n\n(c) apply to claims issued on or after 1 October 2015.\n\n1.3 Where the provisions of this Practice Direction conflict with other provisions of the rules or other practice Directions, this Practice Direction shall take precedence.\n\n1.4 In calculating the time provided by any order fixing, extending or abridging time under the Shorter Trials Scheme the period from 24 December to 2 January next following (both days inclusive) is excluded.\n\n1.5 Where a case is agreed or ordered to be suitable for the Shorter Trials Scheme, the court expects the parties and their representatives to cooperate with, and assist, the court in ensuring the proceeding is conducted in accordance with the Scheme so that the real issues in dispute are identified as early as possible and are dealt with in the most efficient way possible.\n\n---\n\n2. The Shorter Trials Scheme\n\nShorter Trials Scheme - general\n\n2.1 A claim in the Shorter Trials Scheme may be started in any of the Business and Property Courts.\n\n2.2 The Shorter Trials Scheme will not normally be suitable for-\n\n(a) cases including an allegation of fraud or dishonesty;\n\n(b) cases which are likely to require extensive disclosure and/or reliance upon extensive witness or expert evidence;\n\n(c) cases involving multiple issues and multiple parties, save for Part 20 counterclaims for revocation of an intellectual property right;\n\n(d) cases in the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court;\n\n(e) public procurement cases.\n\n2.3 The length of trials in the Shorter Trials Scheme will be no more than 4 days including reading time (and a case will not be suitable for the Scheme if it appears that it will require a longer trial).\n\n2.4 All Shorter Trials Scheme claims will be allocated to a designated judge at the time of the first case management conference (CMC) or earlier if necessary.\n\n2.5 All proceedings in the Shorter Trials Scheme will normally be heard or determined by the designated judge except that-\n\n(a) another judge may hear urgent or vacation applications if the designated judge is not available;\n\n(b) unless the court otherwise orders, any application relating to the enforcement of a judgment or order for the payment of money will be dealt with by a Master of the King's Bench Division or of the Chancery Division or a District Judge;\n\n(c) a case may be case managed and tried by a Master in the Chancery Division, or a District Judge in a Chancery District Registry, with the consent of the parties.\n\n2.6 Provisions in other rules or practice directions which refer to a Master or District Judge are to be read, in relation to claims in the Shorter Trials Scheme, as if they referred to a judge.\n\nStarting proceedings in the Shorter Trials Scheme\n\n2.7 Claims in the Shorter Trials Scheme must be issued in the appropriate registry in the appropriate Business and Property Court.\n\n2.8 As appropriate, the claim form must be marked in the top right hand corner as follows-\n\n(a) \"Business and Property Courts of England and Wales, Commercial Court, Shorter Trials Scheme\";\n\n(b) \"Business and Property Courts in Wales, Shorter Trials Scheme\", \"Business and Property Courts in Manchester , Companies Court, Shorter Trials Scheme\", \"Business and Property Courts of England and Wales, Patents Court, Shorter Trials Scheme\" as appropriate;\n\n(c) \"Business and Property Courts of England and Wales, Technology and Construction Court, Shorter Trials Scheme\";\n\n(d) \"Business and Property Courts of England and Wales, The London Circuit Commercial Court, Shorter Trials Scheme\".\n\nTransferring proceedings to or from the Shorter Trials Scheme\n\n2.9 An application by a defendant, including a Part 20 defendant, for an order transferring proceedings out of the Shorter Trials Scheme should be made promptly and normally not later than the first CMC. An application may be made on paper prior to the first CMC if appropriate.\n\n2.10 If a successful application is made to transfer a case out of the Shorter Trials Scheme, the case will then proceed in the court in which it was issued unless a judge otherwise orders.\n\n2.11 An application to transfer a case into the Shorter Trials Scheme must be heard by a judge, save that in the Chancery Division it may be heard by a Master, or a District Judge in a Chancery District Registry. If a judge or Master orders a case to be transferred into the Shorter Trials Scheme, he may give case management directions.\n\n2.12 An application by any party for an order transferring proceedings into the Shorter Trials Scheme should be made promptly and normally not later than the first CMC.\n\n2.13 The court may, of its own initiative, suggest that a case be transferred into the Shorter Trials Scheme.\n\n2.14 In deciding whether to transfer a case into or out of the Shorter Trials Scheme, without prejudice to the generality of the overriding objective, the court will have regard to the type of case the Scheme is for, the suitability of the case to be a part of the Scheme and the wishes of the parties.\n\n2.15 If a case is transferred into the Shorter Trials Scheme, the court will consider whether it is necessary to require that Statements of Case which have already been served should be amended to put them in the form they would have been in had the case commenced in the scheme. Statements of Case which have already been served will not normally need to be amended.\n\nProceedings in the Shorter Trials Scheme\n\n2.16 The procedure set out in this paragraph shall be substituted for any applicable pre-action protocols.\n\n2.17 Save where there is good reason not to do so, as in a case of urgency, a letter of claim should be sent giving succinct but sufficient details of the claim to enable the potential defendant to understand and to investigate the allegations.\n\n2.18 The letter of claim shall notify the proposed defendant of the intention to adopt the Shorter Trials Scheme procedure.\n\n2.19 The proposed defendant shall respond within 14 days stating whether it agrees to or opposes that procedure, or whether it has insufficient information to commit itself either way.\n\n2.20 Particulars of claim must be served with the claim form.\n\n2.21 In addition to the requirements of rule 16.4, the particulars of claim should include-\n\n(a) a brief summary of the dispute and identification of the anticipated issues;\n\n(b) a full statement of all relief or remedies claimed;\n\n(c) detailed calculations of any sums claimed.\n\n2.22 The particulars of claim should be no more than 20 pages in length. The court will only exceptionally give permission for a longer statement of case to be served for use in the Shorter Trials Scheme and will do so only where a party shows good reasons.\n\n2.23 The particulars of claim should be accompanied by a bundle of core documents.\n\n2.24 The claim form and particulars of claim shall be served promptly following-\n\n(a) the 14 day period allowed for the defendant's response to the letter of claim; or\n\n(b) the defendant's response, if a longer period for response is agreed between the parties.\n\n2.25 The claimant shall, promptly after serving the claim form and particulars of claim, take steps to fix a CMC for a date approximately (but not less than) twelve weeks after the defendant is due to acknowledge service of the claim form.\n\n2.26 The defendant shall be required to file an acknowledgment of service within the time periods prescribed by the rules.\n\n2.27 If the defendant files an acknowledgment of service stating that he wishes to dispute the court's jurisdiction, the period for serving and filing a defence is 28 days after filing of the acknowledgment of service (unless an application to challenge the jurisdiction is made on or before that date, in which case no defence need be served before the hearing of the application: see rules 11(7) and (9)).\n\n2.28 In cases where the jurisdiction of the court is challenged these provisions will not apply until the question of the court's jurisdiction has been resolved.\n\n2.29 The defence and any counterclaim must be served within 28 days of acknowledgment of service of the claim form. Subject to paragraphs 2.27 and 2.33 of this Practice Direction, CPR r 15.4(1) applies to the period of filing the defence.\n\n2.30 The defence should include-\n\n(a) a statement indicating whether it is agreed that the case is appropriate for the Shorter Trials Scheme and, if not, why not;\n\n(b) a summary of the dispute and identification of the anticipated issues (if different to that of the claimant).\n\n2.31 The defence and counterclaim should be no more than 20 pages in length. The court will only exceptionally give permission for a longer statement of case to be served for use in the Shorter Trials Scheme and will do so only where a party shows good reasons.\n\n2.32 The defence should be accompanied by a bundle of any additional core documents on which the defendant intends to rely.\n\n2.33 Unless such extension would require alteration of the date for the CMC, if it has already been fixed, the defendant and the claimant may agree that the period for serving and filing a defence shall be extended by up to 14 days. However, any such agreement and brief reasons must be evidenced in writing and notified to the court.\n\n2.34 Any reply and defence to counterclaim must be served within 14 days thereafter.\n\nCase Management Conference\n\n2.35 If the suitability of the Shorter Trials Scheme procedure is disputed then that issue will be determined at the first CMC, if not before, and further directions given in the light of that determination.\n\n2.36 The legal representatives for the claimant will be responsible for producing and filing a list of issues, and where appropriate for revising it.\n\n2.37 The claimant's legal representatives shall provide a draft list of issues to the defendant's solicitors in sufficient time to enable the parties to use their best endeavours to discuss and agree the contents thereof prior to filing the CMC bundle at court.\n\n2.38 At the CMC the court will-\n\n(a) review the issues;\n\n(b) approve a list of issues;\n\n(c) consider ADR;\n\n(d) give directions for trial;\n\n(e) (if it has not already been done before the CMC,) fix a trial date (or window), which should be not more than 8 months after the CMC and with a trial length of not more than 4 days (including reading time);\n\n(f) fix a date for a Pre-Trial Review.\n\nDisclosure\n\n2.39 Rules 31.5(2) and 31.7 do not apply.\n\n2.40 If and insofar as any party wishes to seek disclosure from another party of particular documents or classes of documents or of documents relating to a particular issue, they must write to the other party to make such requests not less than 14 days in advance of the CMC and, absent an agreement regarding the extent of the disclosure to be given, raise such requests at the CMC.\n\n2.41 Where there is a dispute as to whether requested disclosure should be provided, in deciding whether it is necessary so to order the court will have regard to how narrow and specific the request is, whether the requested documents are likely to be of significant probative value and the reasonableness and proportionality of any related search required, having regard to the factors set out in rule 31.7(2).\n\n2.42 Unless agreed by the parties or otherwise ordered at the CMC, the following provisions for disclosure will apply-\n\n(a) the parties shall, within 4 weeks of the CMC, make and serve a disclosure list in accordance with rule 31.10 and serve copies of all documents in the list, inspection of which is not objected to;\n\n(b) the documents to be listed in the disclosure list are-\n\n(i) the documents on which they rely as supporting their case;\n\n(ii) the documents requested by the other party under paragraph 2.40 above that it agreed to produce or was ordered to produce by the court;\n\n(c) each party must also provide a disclosure statement containing a brief description of the steps the party has taken to locate the document agreed or ordered to be disclosed.\n\n2.43 Applications for specific disclosure and further information made after the CMC are discouraged under the Shorter Trials Scheme and should not be made without good reason.\n\nWitness statements\n\n2.44 Unless otherwise ordered, witness statements will stand as the evidence in chief of the witness at trial. No witness statements should without good reason be more than 25 pages in length.\n\n2.45 The court will consider at the CMC whether to order that witness evidence shall be limited to identified issues or to identified topics.\n\nExperts\n\n2.46 Expert evidence at trial will be given by written reports and oral evidence shall be limited to identified issues, as directed at the CMC or as subsequently agreed by the parties or directed by the court.\n\nApplications\n\n2.47 Part 23 applies with the modifications set out in this paragraph.\n\n2.48 The court will deal with all applications (save for the CMC and pre-trial review) without a hearing in accordance with the following directions-\n\n(a) all applications and documents filed in support must be concise;\n\n(b) the respondent must answer in writing within 7 days of service of the application notice. The response must be concise;(c) any reply from the applicant must be provided within 2 business days of service of the response and be concise;\n\n(d) if any party contends the application should be dealt with at a hearing, they must give an explanation in writing;\n\n(e) The court will deal with an application without a hearing unless the court considers it necessary to hold a hearing. In appropriate cases that may be a hearing by telephone.\n\n2.49 Save as otherwise provided herein the periods set by this Practice Direction and any other time limits applicable to a case in the Shorter Trials Scheme under any rule, practice direction or order of the court may be extended by agreement by up to 7 days. In all other cases, such time limits many only be extended beyond 7 days by order of the court and for good reason.\n\n2.50 Save in exceptional circumstances, the court will not permit a party to submit material at trial in addition to that permitted at the CMC or by later court order.\n\nPre-Trial Review\n\n2.51 At the Pre-Trial Review the court will review the case and will fix the timetable for the trial, including time for speeches and for cross-examination.\n\nThe Trial\n\n2.52 The judge hearing the trial will be the designated judge unless it is impractical for that judge to do so.\n\n2.53 The court will manage the trial to ensure that, save in exceptional circumstances, the trial estimate is adhered to. Cross-examination will be strictly controlled by the court.\n\n2.54 The trial will be conducted on the basis that it is only necessary for a party to put the principal parts of its case to a witness, unless the court directs otherwise.\n\n2.55 The court will endeavour to hand down judgment within six weeks of the trial or (if later) final written submissions.\n\nCosts\n\n2.56 Rule 3.12 shall not apply to cases in the Shorter Trials Scheme, unless the parties otherwise agree. If at the outset of the proceedings the parties agree that Costs Management should apply, they should seek an order to that effect at the CMC and apply for directions as to when budgets should be subsequently exchanged, discussed and submitted for the court's approval.\n\n2.57 Within 21 days of the conclusion of the trial, or within such other period as may be ordered by the court, the parties shall each file and simultaneously exchange schedules of their costs incurred in the proceedings.\n\n2.58 Such schedules should contain sufficient detail of the costs incurred in relation to each applicable phase identified by Precedent H to the Costs Budgeting regime to enable the trial judge to be in a position to make a summary assessment thereof following judgment.\n\n2.59 Save in exceptional circumstances-\n\n(a) the court will make a summary assessment of the costs of the party in whose favour any order for costs is made;\n\n(b) rules 44.2(8), 44.7(1)(b) and Part 47 do not apply.\n\nAppeals\n\n2.60 The Court of Appeal will seek to take into account the fact that a case was in the Shorter Trials Scheme and the desire for expedition in deciding when applications for permission to appeal will be considered and when appeals will be listed.\n\n---\n\n3. The Flexible Trials Scheme\n\nFlexible Trials Scheme - general\n\n3.1 The Flexible Trials Scheme applies to a claim started in any of the Business and Property Courts.\n\n3.2 The Flexible Trials Scheme enables parties by agreement to adapt trial procedure to suit their particular case. Trial procedure encompasses pre-trial disclosure, witness evidence, expert evidence and submissions at trial.\n\n3.3 The Flexible Trials Scheme is designed to encourage parties to limit disclosure and to confine oral evidence at trial to the minimum necessary for the fair resolution of their disputes. Its aim is to reduce costs, reduce the time required for trial and to enable earlier trial dates to be obtained.\n\n3.4 The Flexible Trials Scheme enables the parties to agree to invite the court to determine identified issues on the basis of written evidence and submissions. In such a case, whilst the court will seek to comply with the parties' request, it may call for oral evidence to be given or oral submissions to be made on any of the identified issues if it considers it necessary to do so. Where an issue is to be determined in writing it is not necessary for a party to put its case on that issue to the other party's witnesses.\n\n3.5 The Flexible Trials Scheme provides a standard trial procedure as set out in paragraph 3.9 below, the Flexible Trials Procedure. This may be varied by agreement between the parties.\n\nAdoption of the Flexible Trials Scheme\n\n3.6 If the parties wish to adopt the Flexible Trials Scheme they should agree to do so in advance of the first CMC and inform the court accordingly.\n\n3.7 If the parties wish to adopt a variation of the Flexible Trials Procedure such variations should be agreed in advance of the first CMC and the court informed accordingly.\n\n3.8 Unless there is good reason to order otherwise, where the parties have adopted the Flexible Trials Scheme the court will give directions in accordance with Flexible Trials Procedure and any agreed variations of it.\n\nFlexible Trials Procedure\n\n3.9 Unless otherwise ordered, the following directions apply where the Flexible Trials Scheme is adopted-\n\n(a) each party will be required to disclose the documents on which he relies and documents which are actually known to fall within rules 31.6(b) or (c) without the need for a search. At the same time the party may request specific disclosure of documents it requires from any other party. If the parties wish to agree that there be wider disclosure in accordance with rule 31.5(7)(a) to (f) they should seek to do so in relation to limited and defined issues;\n\n(b) where there is a dispute as to whether specific disclosure should be provided in deciding whether it is necessary so to order the court will have regard to how narrow and specific the request is, whether the requested documents are likely to be of significant probative value and the reasonableness and proportionality of any related search required, having regard to the factors set out in rule 31.7(2). A party is only required to carry out a reasonable search and to provide a disclosure statement pursuant to rule 31.7 in relation to specific disclosure which it has agreed or been ordered to provide;\n\n(c) witness evidence at trial will be given by written statements and oral evidence shall be limited to identified issues or identified witnesses, as directed at the CMC or as subsequently agreed by the parties or directed by the court;\n\n(d) expert evidence at trial will be given by written reports and oral evidence shall be limited to identified issues, as directed at the CMC or as subsequently agreed by the parties or directed by the court;\n\n(e) submissions at trial will be made in writing with oral submissions and cross examination subject to a time limit, as directed at the CMC or as subsequently agreed by the parties or directed by the court;\n\n(f) where an issue is to be determined at trial on the basis of written evidence it is not necessary for a party to put its case on that issue to the other party's witnesses. Where an issue is to be determined on the basis of oral evidence it is only necessary for a party to put the principal parts of its case to the other party's witnesses, unless the court directs otherwise.\"",

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 57 AC - TRIAL WITNESS STATEMENTS IN THE BUSINESS AND PROPERTY COURTS\n\n---\n\n1. General\n\n1.1 This Practice Direction is made under rule 57 A.3. It concerns witness statements for use at trials in the Business and Property Courts and applies to new and existing proceedings, but only to trial witness statements signed on or after 6 April 2021. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Practice Direction affects-\n\n(1) affidavit evidence,\n\n(2) evidence in a witness statement other than a trial witness statement, or\n\n(3) the general powers of the court under rule 32.1, to control, exclude or limit factual witness evidence.\n\n(Rule 32.6 provides for evidence in proceedings other than at trial; rule 32.15 provides where evidence may or must be given in the form of an affidavit.)\n\n1.2 In this Practice Direction (including the Appendix) -\n\n\"relevant court guide\" means any of the court guides referred to by paragraph 1.7 of Practice Direction 57 AA that is applicable to the proceedings,\n\n\"relevant legal representative\" means, in relation to a trial witness statement, a legal representative authorised to conduct litigation who has had responsibility for ensuring that the purpose and proper content of trial witness statements and proper practice in relation to their preparation have been explained to and understood by the witness (and \"legal representative\" has the meaning given in rule 2.3),\n\n\"trial\" means a final trial hearing, whether of all issues or of only one or some particular issues, in proceedings (except as provided in paragraph 1.3 below) in any of the Business and Property Courts under CPR Part 7 or Part 8 or upon an unfair prejudice petition under section 994 of the Companies Act 2006 or a contributory's just and equitable winding up petition under section 122(1)(g) of the Insolvency Act 1986,\n\n\"trial witness statement\" means a witness statement that is served pursuant to an order made under rule 32.4(2), or pursuant to rule 8.5 or an order made under rule 8.6(1)(b), or that is prepared for the trial of an unfair prejudice petition or a contributory's just and equitable winding up petition, including supplemental or reply witness statements where allowed by the court, and\n\n\"relevant party\" means the party by or on behalf of whom the witness statement is served (and for the avoidance of doubt includes a party who is also a witness, as regards their own trial witness statement).\n\n(Rule 32.4(2) requires the court to order service of witness statements for use at trials; rules 8.5 and 8.6 provide for the service and use of written witness evidence in proceedings under Part 8.)\n\n1.3 This Practice Direction does not apply to the following proceedings, unless the court at any stage directs that it is to apply:\n\n(1) an application under Part VII of the Financial Service and Markets Act 2000 for an order sanctioning an insurance business transfer scheme, a banking business transfer scheme, a reclaim fund business transfer scheme or a ring-fencing transfer scheme;\n\n(2) an application under Part XXV of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 for an injunction or restitution in connection with contravention of relevant requirements, as defined in that Act;\n\n(3) an application for an order under the Insolvency Act 1986 (other than a contributory's just and equitable winding up petition under s.122(1)(g) of that Act), under the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, under any enactment or statutory instrument providing for a special insolvency or administration regime, and under Schedule 2 to The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006;\n\n(4) a claim made under the Companies Act 2006 listed in Part II of Practice Direction 49 A of the Civil Procedure Rules (whether in relation to limited companies or limited liability partnerships), an application for an order under Part 26 A of that Act, a claim to restore a company to the register under section 1029 of that Act and a claim under Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 listed in Part III of Practice Direction 49 A;\n\n(5) an application under Part II of The Companies (Cross-Border Mergers) Regulations 2007;\n\n(6) proceedings falling within CPR Part 57, which applies to probate claims, claims for the rectification of wills, claims to substitute or remove a personal representative, and claims under the Inheritance (Provision for Family Dependants) Act 1975, the Presumption of Death Act 2013 and the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Act 2017;\n\n(7) proceedings in the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court falling within Section V of Practice Direction 63;\n\n(8) proceedings under CPR Part 64, which applies to certain claims relating to the administration of estates of deceased persons or trusts (Section I of Part 64), and to charity proceedings (Section II of Part 64);\n\n(9) proceedings in the Technology and Construction Court relating to adjudication awards under Section 9 of the TCC Guide;\n\n(10) proceedings including a claim for the rectification of pension scheme deeds, rules or other governing documents.\n\n1.4 If a rule or other Practice Direction requires some matter to be stated in a witness statement that will be a trial witness statement, that requirement still applies\n\n1.5 In the event of inconsistency between this Practice Direction and any other Practice Direction the provisions of this Practice Direction shall prevail.\n\n---\n\n2. The purpose of a trial witness statement\n\n2.1 The purpose of a trial witness statement is to set out in writing the evidence in chief that a witness of fact would give if they were allowed to give oral evidence at trial without having provided the statement.\n\n(Rule 32.2(1)(a) provides that in general any fact which needs to be proved at trial by the evidence of witnesses is to be proved by their oral evidence given in public, and rule 32.4(1) defines a witness statement as a signed statement containing the evidence the witness would be allowed to give orally.)\n\n2.2 Trial witness statements are important in informing the parties and the court of the evidence a party intends to rely on at trial. Their use promotes the overriding objective by helping the court to deal with cases justly, efficiently and at proportionate cost, including by helping to put parties on an equal footing, saving time at trial and promoting settlement in advance of trial.\n\n(The overriding objective is defined in rule 1.1.)\n\n---\n\n3. The content of witness statements\n\n3.1 A trial witness statement must contain only -\n\n(1) evidence as to matters of fact that need to be proved at trial by the evidence of witnesses in relation to one or more of the issues of fact to be decided at trial, and\n\n(2) the evidence as to such matters that the witness would be asked by the relevant party to give, and the witness would be allowed to give, in evidence in chief if they were called to give oral evidence at trial and rule 32.5(2) did not apply.\n\n(Rule 32.5(2) provides that where a witness is called to give oral evidence at trial, their witness statement shall stand as their evidence in chief unless the court orders otherwise.)\n\n3.2 A trial witness statement must set out only matters of fact of which the witness has personal knowledge that are relevant to the case, and must identify by list what documents, if any, the witness has referred to or been referred to for the purpose of providing the evidence set out in their trial witness statement. The requirement to identify documents the witness has referred to or been referred to does not affect any privilege that may exist in relation to any of those documents.\n\n3.3 A trial witness statement must comply with paragraphs 18.1 and 18.2 of Practice Direction 32, and for that purpose a witness's own language includes any language in which the witness is sufficiently fluent to give oral evidence (including under cross-examination) if required, and is not limited to a witness's first or native language.\n\n(Paragraph 18.1 of Practice Direction 32 requires a trial witness statement to be in the witness's own words, if practicable, and to be drafted in the witness's own language and in the first person; paragraphs 18.1(1) to (5) and 18.2 set out further requirements; paragraph 23 of Practice Direction 32 provides that a party who relies on a witness statement in a foreign language must also file a translation.)\n\n3.4 Trial witness statements should be prepared in accordance with -\n\n(1) the Statement of Best Practice contained in the Appendix to this Practice Direction, and\n\n(2) any relevant court guide, for which purpose, in the event of any inconsistency, the Statement of Best Practice takes precedence over any court guide.\n\n---\n\n4. Confirmation of compliance\n\n4.1 A trial witness statement must be verified by a statement of truth as required by rule 22.1(b) and paragraph 20.2 of Practice Direction 32 and, unless the court otherwise orders, must also include the following confirmation, signed by the witness:\n\n\" I understand that the purpose of this witness statement is to set out matters of fact of which I have personal knowledge.I understand that it is not my function to argue the case, either generally or on particular points, or to take the court through the documents in the case.\n\nThis witness statement sets out only my personal knowledge and recollection, in my own words.\n\nOn points that I understand to be important in the case, I have stated honestly (a) how well I recall matters and (b) whether my memory has been refreshed by considering documents, if so how and when.\n\nI have not been asked or encouraged by anyone to include in this statement anything that is not my own account, to the best of my ability and recollection, of events I witnessed or matters of which I have personal knowledge. \"\n\n4.2 Any application for permission to vary or depart from the requirement to include the statement set out in paragraph 4.1 above may be made, and generally should be made, without notice, for determination without a hearing.\n\n4.3 A trial witness statement must be endorsed with a certificate of compliance in the following form, signed by the relevant legal representative, unless the statement is signed when the relevant party is a litigant in person or the court orders otherwise:\n\n\"I hereby certify that:1.I am the relevant legal representative within the meaning of Practice Direction 57 AC.\n\n2.I am satisfied that the purpose and proper content of trial witness statements, and proper practice in relation to their preparation, including the witness confirmation required by paragraph 4.1 of Practice Direction 57 AC, have been discussed with and explained to [name of witness].\n\n3.I believe this trial witness statement complies with Practice Direction 57 AC and paragraphs 18.1 and 18.2 of Practice Direction 32, and that it has been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Best Practice contained in the Appendix to Practice Direction 57 AC.\n\nName: …………………………Position: …………………………Date:…………………………\"\n\n4.4 Any application to dispense with the certificate of compliance referred to in paragraph 4.3 above, or for permission to vary or depart from the form for it there set out, may be made, and generally should be made, without notice, for determination without a hearing.\n\n---\n\n5. Sanctions\n\n5.1 The court retains its full powers of case management and the full range of sanctions available to it and nothing in paragraph 5.2 or paragraph 5.3 below confines either.\n\n5.2 If a party fails to comply with any part of this Practice Direction, the court may, upon application by any other party or of its own motion, do one or more of the following -\n\n(1) refuse to give or withdraw permission to rely on, or strike out, part or all of a trial witness statement,\n\n(2) order that a trial witness statement be re-drafted in accordance with this Practice Direction or as may be directed by the court,\n\n(3) make an adverse costs order against the non-complying party,\n\n(4) order a witness to give some or all of their evidence in chief orally.\n\n5.3 The court may, upon application by any other party or of its own motion, strike out a trial witness statement not endorsed with a certificate of compliance pursuant to paragraph 4.3 above if there is reason to consider that the relevant party was acting in person when it was signed in order to avoid the application of paragraph 4.3 above to the statement.\n\n---\n\nAppendix to Practice Direction 57 AC\n\n(Statement of Best Practice in relation to Trial Witness Statements)\n\n---\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1 This Appendix contains the Statement of Best Practice referred to in paragraph 3.4(1) of Practice Direction 57 AC that should be followed in relation to trial witness statements as defined in paragraph 1.2 of that Practice Direction. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Appendix removes or limits any privilege that would otherwise attach to documents generated by or for the purpose of obtaining evidence for use in litigation.\n\n1.2 In this Appendix -\n\na \"leading question\" means a question that expressly or by implication suggests a desired answer or puts words into the mouth, or information into the mind, of a witness.\n\n1.3 Witnesses of fact and those assisting them to provide a trial witness statement should understand that when assessing witness evidence the approach of the court is that human memory:\n\n(1) is not a simple mental record of a witnessed event that is fixed at the time of the experience and fades over time, but\n\n(2) is a fluid and malleable state of perception concerning an individual's past experiences, and therefore\n\n(3) is vulnerable to being altered by a range of influences, such that the individual may or may not be conscious of the alteration.\n\n---\n\n2. Principles\n\n2.1 The content of any trial witness statement should be limited to the evidence in chief the relevant party and its legal representatives (if the party is represented) believe the witness would give if\n\n(1) rule 32.5(2) did not apply (so the witness statement would not stand as the evidence in chief of the witness), and\n\n(2) the principles set out in paragraphs 2.2 to 2.6 were followed.\n\n2.2 In trials in the Business and Property Courts, often many matters of fact do not require witness evidence, either because they are common ground or because witness testimony adds nothing of substance to the disclosed documents. The fact that there is or may be an issue concerning what the disclosed documents mean or show does not, without more, mean that witness evidence is required.\n\n2.3 Factual witnesses give evidence at trials to provide the court with testimony as to matters of which they have personal knowledge, including their recollection of matters they witnessed personally, where such testimony is relevant to issues of fact to be determined at trial, and:\n\n(1) a matter will have been witnessed personally by a witness only if it was experienced by one of their primary senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch or taste), or if it was a matter internal to their mind (for example, what they thought about something at some time in the past or why they took some past decision or action),\n\n(2) for the avoidance of doubt, factual witness testimony may include evidence of things said to a witness, since the witness can testify to the statement made to them, if (a) the fact that the statement was made to the witness is itself relevant to an issue to be determined at trial or (b) the truth of what was said to the witness is relevant to such an issue and the statement made to the witness is to be relied on as hearsay evidence.\n\n2.4 The duty of factual witnesses is to give the court an honest account of matters known personally to them (including, if relevant to the issues in the case, what they recall as to matters witnessed personally by them or what they would or would not have done or thought if the facts, or their understanding of them, had been different). It is improper to put pressure of any kind on a witness to give anything other than their own account, to the best of their ability and recollection, of the matters about which the witness is asked to give evidence.\n\n2.5 The evidence in chief of a factual witness, if not given by witness statement, must be given to the court without the use of leading questions (except where their use has been permitted by the court).\n\n2.6 During evidence in chief given otherwise than by witness statement, the witness's memory may be refreshed by being shown a document, but only if the witness created or saw the document while the facts evidenced by or referred to in the document were still fresh in their mind, so that they would have known if they were accurate or inaccurate.\n\n---\n\n3. Practice\n\nGeneral\n\n3.1 Paragraphs 3.2 to 3.8 below apply to all trial witness statements. Paragraphs 3.9 to 3.13 below do not apply to a trial witness statement where the relevant party (as defined in paragraph 1.2 of Practice Direction 57 AC) is a litigant in person when the statement is prepared and signed. Paragraphs 3.14 to 3.16 below apply only to a trial witness statement where the relevant party is a litigant in person when the statement is prepared and signed.\n\n3.2 Any trial witness statement should be prepared in such a way as to avoid so far as possible any practice that might alter or influence the recollection of the witness other than by refreshment of memory as described in paragraph 2.6 above.\n\n3.3 Trial witness statements should be as concise as possible without omitting anything of significance.\n\n3.4 A trial witness statement should refer to documents, if at all, only where necessary. It will generally not be necessary for a trial witness statement to refer to documents beyond providing a list to comply with paragraph 3.2 of Practice Direction 57 AC, unless paragraph 3.7 below applies or the witness's evidence is required to:\n\n(1) prove or disprove the content, date or authenticity of the document;\n\n(2) explain that the witness understood a document, or particular words or phrases, in a certain way when sending, receiving or otherwise encountering a document in the past; or\n\n(3) confirm that the witness saw or did not see the document at the relevant time;\n\nbut in the case of (1) to (3) above if (and only if) such evidence is relevant. Particular caution should be exercised before or when showing a witness any document they did not create or see while the facts evidenced by or referred to in the document were fresh in their mind. Where a trial witness statement does refer to a document, it should not exhibit the document but should give a reference enabling it to be identified by the parties, unless it is a document being produced or disclosed by the witness that has not been disclosed in the proceedings.\n\n3.5 The document list to comply with paragraph 3.2 of Practice Direction 57 AC should identify or describe the documents in such a way that they may be located easily at trial. Documents disclosed in the proceedings may be listed by disclosure reference. Privileged documents may be identified by category or general description.\n\n3.6 Trial witness statements should not -\n\n(1) quote at any length from any document to which reference is made,\n\n(2) seek to argue the case, either generally or on particular points,\n\n(3) take the court through the documents in the case or set out a narrative derived from the documents, those being matters for argument, or\n\n(4) include commentary on other evidence in the case (either documents or the evidence of other witnesses), that is to say set out matters of belief, opinion or argument about the meaning, effect, relevance or significance of that other evidence (save as set out at paragraph 3.4 above).\n\n3.7 On important disputed matters of fact, a trial witness statement should, if practicable -\n\n(1) state in the witness's own words how well they recall the matters addressed,\n\n(2) state whether, and if so how and when, the witness's recollection in relation to those matters has been refreshed by reference to documents, identifying those documents.\n\n3.8 The preparation of a trial witness statement should involve as few drafts as practicable. Any process of repeatedly revisiting a draft statement may corrupt rather than improve recollection.\n\nRepresented Parties\n\n3.9 Any witness providing a trial witness statement should have explained to them, by the legal representatives of the relevant party, the purpose and proper content of such a statement and proper practice in relation to its preparation, before they are asked to prepare or consider any draft statement and, wherever practicable, before any evidence is obtained from them (by interview or otherwise). This should include ensuring that the witness has read, or reading to them, the witness confirmation required by paragraph 4.1 of Practice Direction 57 AC.\n\n3.10 Wherever practicable -\n\n(1) a trial witness statement should be based upon a record or notes made by the relevant party's legal representatives of evidence they obtained from the witness,\n\n(2) any such record or notes should be made from, and if possible during, an interview or interviews (using any convenient format, for example face to face meeting, video or telephone call or conference, webchat or instant messaging),\n\nIf a trial witness statement is based upon evidence obtained from the witness by other means (for example by written answers to a questionnaire or the exchange of emails or other forms of correspondence, or by the witness preparing their own draft statement), the guidance set out in this Appendix should still be followed, so far as possible and modified as necessary.\n\n3.11 An interview to obtain evidence from a witness -\n\n(1) should avoid leading questions where practicable, and should not use leading questions in relation to important contentious matters,\n\n(2) should use open questions as much as possible, generally limiting closed questions to requests for clarification of or additional detail about prior answers, and\n\n(3) should be recorded as fully and accurately as possible, by contemporaneous note or other durable record, dated and retained by the legal representatives.\n\n3.12 If a trial witness statement is not based upon evidence obtained by means of an interview or interviews, that should be stated at the beginning of the statement and the process used instead should be described (to the extent possible without waiver of privilege).\n\n(Paragraph 18.1(5) of Practice Direction 32 provides that any trial witness statement should state the process by which it has been prepared.)\n\n3.13 The legal representatives of the relevant party should assist the witness as to the structure, layout and scope of the statement and may take primary responsibility for drafting it, but in that case the content should be taken from, and should not go beyond, the content of the record or notes referred to in paragraph 3.10(1) above where such a record or such notes exists or exist. If the legal representatives wish to indicate in a draft for a trial witness statement that further evidence is sought from the witness to clarify or complete the statement, that should be done by non-leading questions for the witness to answer in their own words and not by proposing content for approval, amendment or rejection by the witness.\n\nLitigants in Person\n\n3.14 Any witness providing a trial witness statement should read and understand the statement set out in paragraph 4.1 of Practice Direction 57 AC, before any draft for the trial witness statement is prepared. That applies to a litigant in person in relation to their own trial witness statement, if there is one, as well as to other witnesses providing statements.\n\n3.15 A litigant in person should understand that any trial witness statement must set out only what the witness providing the statement says are known personally to them or says they remember about matters witnessed personally by them. That applies to the litigant in person's own trial witness statement, if there is one, as well as to any witness statements provided by other witnesses. Witness statements must not be used to argue the litigant's case.\n\n3.16 A trial witness statement may be prepared by reference to answers provided by the witness to questions posed by the relevant party. Where that is done, (1) leading questions should be avoided where possible, especially on important points, and (2) a full record should be kept by the relevant party of the questions posed and the answers provided, whatever form the trial witness statement takes. The content of any trial witness statement should be in the witness's own words so far as practicable and no one should suggest to any witness what factual account they should or might wish to give (or not give) in a statement.",

    "content": "Document: Practice Direction 57AD – Disclosure for the Business and Property Courts\nPart 1 of 3\n==================================================\nPRACTICE DIRECTION 57 AD - DISCLOSURE IN THE BUSINESS AND PROPERTY COURTS 1. General\n\n1.1 This Practice Direction provides for disclosure in the Business and Property Courts.\n\n1.2 The Commencement Date is 1 October 2022. This Practice Direction applies to existing and new proceedings in the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales and the Business and Property Courts in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle. For the avoidance of doubt, it does not apply in the County Court. This Practice Direction is substantially in the form of (and replaces) Practice Direction 51 U.\n\n1.3 This Practice Direction shall not disturb an order for disclosure made before the Commencement Date or before the transfer of proceedings into a Business and Property Court, unless that order is varied or set aside. If proceedings are transferred out of one of the Business and Property Courts into a court that is not one of the Business and Property Courts, any order for disclosure made under this Practice Direction will stand unless and until any other order is made by the transferee court.\n\n1.4 This Practice Direction shall not, unless otherwise ordered, apply to proceedings which are-\n\n(1) a Competition claim as defined in Practice Direction 31 C;\n\n(2) a Public Procurement claim;\n\n(3) within the Intellectual Property and Enterprise Court;\n\n(4) within the Admiralty Court;\n\n(5) within the Shorter and Flexible Trials Schemes;\n\n(6) within a fixed costs regime or a capped costs regime; or\n\n(7) claims proceeding under Part 8.\n\n1.5 In the Patents Court, PD 63 paragraphs 6.1 to 6.3 will continue to apply under this Practice Direction with the following modification: unless the court expressly orders otherwise, no provision in this practice direction nor any disclosure order made under this Practice Direction will take effect as requiring disclosure wider than is provided for in PD 63 paragraph 6.1.\n\n1.6 For the purposes of this Practice Direction, where its provisions conflict with other provisions of the rules or other Practice Directions, this Practice Direction shall take precedence.\n\n1.7 Terms in Section I of this Practice Direction shall have the meaning given to them in the schedule of definitions at Appendix 1.\n\n1.8 Save for those provisions of CPR Part 31 that are set out in Section II, and the related provisions of Practice Directions 31 A and 31 B, CPR Part 31 and Practice Directions 31 A and 31 B shall not apply to any proceedings falling within this Practice Direction.\n\n1.9 Save that references in Section II to an Electronic Documents Questionnaire should be treated as references to the Disclosure Review Document, nothing in this Practice Direction is intended to change the application or working of those provisions of CPR Part 31 that are set out in Section II and the related provisions of Practice Directions 31 A and 31 B, and CPR Part 31 as a whole should still be used to interpret those provisions.\n\n1.10 Provisions relating to Extended Disclosure in Less Complex Claims are contained in Appendix 5. Less Complex Claims are defined in paragraph 1.9 of Appendix 1 to this Practice Direction.\n\n1.11 This Practice Direction applies in multi-party cases. However, the court may order that the timetable and procedure is to be varied so as to provide a bespoke timetable and procedure to meet the needs of the individual multi-party case. Any application to the court in this connection should be made at an early stage.\n\n1.12 A party seeking an order for disclosure in a Part 8 claim shall serve and file a List of Issues for Disclosure in relation to which disclosure is sought and the Models that are to be adopted for each issue. The court may adapt the provisions of this Practice Direction in such manner as may be appropriate when making an order for disclosure in a Part 8 claim. SECTION I 2. Principles, \"document\", \"adverse\" and \"known adverse documents\"\n\n2.1 Disclosure is important in achieving the fair resolution of civil proceedings. It involves identifying and making available documents that are relevant to the issues in the proceedings.\n\n2.2 For the purpose of disclosure, the term \"document\" includes any record of any description containing information. The term is further defined below.\n\n2.3 The court expects the parties (and their representatives) to cooperate with each other and to assist the court so that the scope of disclosure, if any, that is required in proceedings can be agreed or determined by the court in the most efficient way possible.\n\n2.4 The court will be concerned to ensure that disclosure is directed to the issues in the proceedings and that the scope of disclosure is not wider than is reasonable and proportionate (as defined in paragraph 6.4) in order fairly to resolve those issues, and specifically the Issues for Disclosure (as defined in paragraph 7.6).\n\n2.5 A \"document\" may take any form including but not limited to paper or electronic; it may be held by computer or on portable devices such as memory sticks or mobile phones or within databases; it includes e-mail and other electronic communications such as text messages, webmail, social media and voicemail, audio or visual recordings.\n\n2.6 In addition to information that is readily accessible from computer systems and other electronic devices and media, the term \"document\" extends to information that is stored on servers and back-up systems and electronic information that has been 'deleted'. It also extends to metadata, and other embedded data which is not typically visible on screen or a printout.\n\n2.7 Disclosure extends to \"adverse\" documents. A document is \"adverse\" if it or any information it contains contradicts or materially damages the disclosing party's contention or version of events on an issue in dispute, or supports the contention or version of events of an opposing party on an issue in dispute, whether or not that issue is one of the agreed Issues for Disclosure.\n\n2.8\"Known adverse documents\" are documents (other than privileged documents) that a party is actually aware (without undertaking any further search for documents than it has already undertaken or caused to be undertaken) both (a) are or were previously within its control and (b) are adverse.\n\n2.9 For this purpose a company or organisation is \"aware\" if any person with accountability or responsibility within the company or organisation for the events or the circumstances which are the subject of the case, or for the conduct of the proceedings, is aware. For this purpose it is also necessary to take reasonable steps to check the position with any person who has had such accountability or responsibility but who has since left the company or organisation. 3. Duties in relation to disclosure\n\n3.1 A person who knows that it is or may become a party to proceedings that have been commenced or who knows that it may become a party to proceedings that may be commenced is under the following duties (\"the Disclosure Duties\") to the court-\n\n(1) to take reasonable steps to preserve documents in its control that may be relevant to any issue in the proceedings;\n\n(2) by no later than the time(s) set out in paragraphs 9.1 to 9.3, to disclose known adverse documents, unless they are privileged. This duty exists regardless of whether or not any order for disclosure is made;\n\n(3) to comply with any order for disclosure made by the court;\n\n(4) to undertake any search for documents in a responsible and conscientious manner to fulfil the stated purpose of the search;\n\n(5) to act honestly in relation to the process of giving disclosure and reviewing documents disclosed by the other party; and\n\n(6) to use reasonable efforts to avoid providing documents to another party that have no relevance to the Issues for Disclosure in the proceedings.\n\n3.2 Legal representatives who have the conduct of litigation on behalf of a party to proceedings that have been commenced, or who are instructed with a view to the conduct of litigation where their client knows it may become a party to proceedings that have been or may be commenced, are under the following duties to the court-\n\n(1) to take reasonable steps to preserve documents within their control that may be relevant to any issue in the proceedings;\n\n(2) to take reasonable steps to advise and assist the party to comply with its Disclosure Duties;\n\n(3) to liaise and cooperate with the legal representatives of the other parties to the proceedings (or the other parties where they do not have legal representatives) so as to promote the reliable, efficient and cost-effective conduct of disclosure, including through the use of technology;\n\n(4) to act honestly in relation to the process of giving disclosure and reviewing documents disclosed by the other party; and\n\n(5) to undertake a review to satisfy themselves that any claim by the party to privilege from disclosing a document is properly made and the reason for the claim to privilege is sufficiently explained.\n\n3.3 The duties under paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 above are continuing duties that last until the conclusion of the proceedings (including any appeal) or until it is clear there will be no proceedings.\n\n3.4 Where there is a known adverse document but it has not been located, the duty to disclose the document is met by that fact being disclosed, subject to any further order that the court may make. 4. Preservation of documents\n\n4.1 Documents to be preserved in accordance with the duties under paragraphs 3.1(1) and 3.2(1) above include documents which might otherwise be deleted or destroyed in accordance with a document retention policy or in the ordinary course of business. Preservation includes, in suitable cases, making copies of sources and documents and storing them.\n\n4.2 The duty under paragraph 3.1(1) and 3.2(1) includes-\n\n(1) an obligation to suspend relevant document deletion or destruction processes for the duration of the proceedings;\n\n(2) in accordance with paragraph 4.3 below, an obligation to send a written notification in any form to relevant employees and former employees of the party where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the employee or former employee may be in possession of disclosable documents which are not also in the party's possession; and\n\n(3) an obligation to take reasonable steps so that agents or third parties who may hold documents on the party's behalf do not delete or destroy documents that may be relevant to an issue in the proceedings.\n\n4.3 A written notification under paragraph 4.2 above should-\n\n(1) identify the documents or classes of documents to be preserved; and\n\n(2) notify the recipient that they should not delete or destroy those documents and should take reasonable steps to preserve them.\n\n4.4 Legal representatives who have the conduct of litigation on behalf of a party to proceedings that have been commenced, or who are instructed with a view to the conduct of litigation where their client knows it may become a party to proceedings that have been or may be commenced, must within a reasonable period of being instructed-\n\n(1) notify their client of the need to preserve documents and of their obligations under paragraph 3.1 above; and\n\n(2) obtain written confirmation from their client or an appropriate representative of their client that their client has taken the steps required under paragraphs 4.2 and 4.3 above.\n\n4.5 Each party must confirm in writing (and may do so by their legal representative) when serving their particulars of claim or defence (as appropriate), that steps have been taken to preserve relevant documents in accordance with the duties under paragraph 3.1(1) and 3.2(1) above, and as required by paragraph 4.1 to 4.4 above. 5. Initial Disclosure\n\n5.1 Save as provided below, and save in the case of a Part 7 claim form without particulars of claim, each party must provide to all other parties at the same time as its statement of case an Initial Disclosure List of Documents that lists and is accompanied by copies of-\n\n(1) the key documents on which it has relied (expressly or otherwise) in support of the claims or defences advanced in its statement of case (and including the documents referred to in that statement of case); and\n\n(2) the key documents that are necessary to enable the other parties to understand the claim or defence they have to meet.\n\n5.2 This form of disclosure is known as \"Initial Disclosure\".\n\n5.3 Initial Disclosure is not required where-\n\n(1) the parties have agreed to dispense with it (see paragraph 5.8 below);\n\n(2) the court has ordered that it is not required (see paragraph 5.10 below); or\n\n(3) a party concludes and states in writing, approaching the matter in good faith, that giving Initial Disclosure would involve it or any other party providing (after removing duplicates, and including documents referred to at paragraph 5.4(3)(a)) more than (about) whichever is the larger of 1000 pages or 200 documents (or such higher but reasonable figure as the parties may agree), at which point the requirement to give Initial Disclosure ceases for all parties for the purposes of the case.\n\nDocuments comprising media not in page form are not included in the calculation of the page or document limit at (3) but, where provided pursuant to a requirement to give Initial Disclosure, should be confined strictly to what is necessary to comply with paragraph 5.1 above.\n\n5.4 A party giving Initial Disclosure-\n\n(1) is under no obligation to undertake a search for documents beyond any search it has already undertaken or caused to be undertaken for the purposes of the proceedings (including in advance of the commencement of the proceedings);\n\n(2) need not provide unless requested documents by way of Initial Disclosure if such documents-\n\n(a) have already been provided to the other party, whether by disclosure before proceedings start (see CPR 31.16) or through pre-action correspondence or otherwise in the period following intimation of the proceedings (and including when giving Initial Disclosure with a statement of case that is being amended); or\n\n(b) are known to be or have been in the other party's possession;\n\n(3) need not disclose adverse documents by way of Initial Disclosure.\n\n5.5 Unless otherwise ordered, or agreed between the parties, copies of documents shall be provided in electronic form for the purpose of Initial Disclosure. The Initial Disclosure List of Documents should be filed but the documents must not be filed.\n\n5.6 In proceedings where a statement of case is to be served on a defendant out of the jurisdiction Initial Disclosure is not required in respect of that defendant unless and until that defendant files an acknowledgement of service that does not contest the jurisdiction, or files a further acknowledgement of service under CPR 11(7)(b).\n\n5.7 For the avoidance of doubt, Initial Disclosure does not require any document to be translated.\n\n5.8 The parties may agree in writing, before or after the commencement of proceedings, to dispense with, or defer, Initial Disclosure. They may also agree to dispense with the requirement to produce an Initial Disclosure List of Documents. Each party should record its respective reasons for any agreement, so that those reasons may be available to the court, on request, at any case management conference. The court may set aside an agreement to dispense with or defer Initial Disclosure if it considers that Initial Disclosure is likely to provide significant benefits and the costs of providing Initial Disclosure are unlikely to be disproportionate to such benefits.\n\n5.9 The court shall disregard any prior agreement to dispense with Initial Disclosure when considering whether to order Extended Disclosure.\n\n5.10 A party may apply to the court for directions limiting or abrogating the obligation to provide Initial Disclosure. In particular, if a party is requested but does not agree to dispense with Initial Disclosure, the requesting party may apply to the court with notice to the other party for directions limiting or abrogating the obligation to provide Initial Disclosure if it considers compliance with the obligation will incur disproportionate cost or be unduly complex. Such an application must be made by application notice, supported by evidence where necessary, and, save in exceptional cases, will be dealt with without a hearing or at a short telephone hearing.\n\n5.11 In an appropriate case the court may, on application, and whether or not Initial Disclosure has been given, require a party to disclose documents to another party where that is necessary to enable the other party to understand the claim or defence they have to meet or to formulate a defence or a reply.\n\n5.12 A complaint about Initial Disclosure shall be dealt with at the first case management conference unless, exceptionally and on application, the court considers that the issue should be resolved at an earlier hearing.\n\n5.13 A significant failure to comply with the obligation to provide Initial Disclosure may be taken into account by the court when considering whether to make an order for Extended Disclosure and the terms of such an order. It may also result in an adverse order for costs.\n\n5.14 For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph affects the operation of paragraph 7.3 of Practice Direction 16. 6. Extended Disclosure\n\n6.1 A party wishing to seek disclosure of documents in addition to, or as an alternative to, Initial Disclosure must request Extended Disclosure. No application notice is required. However, the parties will be expected to have completed the Disclosure Review Document pursuant to paragraphs 7 and following below.\n\n6.2 Save where otherwise provided, Extended Disclosure involves using Disclosure Models (see paragraph 8 below) in respect of Issues for Disclosure which have been identified (see paragraph 7 below).\n\n6.3 The court will only make an order for Extended Disclosure that is search-based (ie Models C, D and/or E) where it is persuaded that it is appropriate to do so in order fairly to resolve one or more of the Issues for Disclosure.\n\n6.4 In all cases, an order for Extended Disclosure must be reasonable and proportionate having regard to the overriding objective including the following factors-\n\n(1) the nature and complexity of the issues in the proceedings;\n\n(2) the importance of the case, including any non-monetary relief sought;\n\n(3) the likelihood of documents existing that will have probative value in supporting or undermining a party's claim or defence;\n\n(4) the number of documents involved;\n\n(5) the ease and expense of searching for and retrieval of any particular document (taking into account any limitations on the information available and on the likely accuracy of any costs estimates);\n\n(6) the financial position of each party; and\n\n(7) the need to ensure the case is dealt with expeditiously, fairly and at a proportionate cost.\n\n6.5 A request for search-based Extended Disclosure (ie Models C, D and/or E) must specify which of the Disclosure Models listed in paragraph 8 below is proposed for each Issue for Disclosure defined in paragraph 7 below. It is for the party requesting Extended Disclosure to show that what is sought is appropriate, reasonable and proportionate (as defined in paragraph 6.4).\n\n6.6 The objective of relating Disclosure Models to Issues for Disclosure is to limit the searches required and the volume of documents to be disclosed. Issues for Disclosure may be grouped. Disclosure Models should not be used in a way that increases cost through undue complexity.\n\n6.7 It is important that the parties consider what types of documents and sources of documents there are or may be, including what documents another party is likely to have, in order that throughout a realistic approach may be taken to disclosure.\n\nCourt control over disclosure\n\n6.8 The court will determine whether to order Extended Disclosure at the first case management conference or, if directed by the court, at another hearing convened for that purpose or without a hearing.\n\n6.9 The court may determine any point at issue between the parties about disclosure including the application or effect of any provision in this Practice Direction or an order made by the court and about the scope of searches, the manner in which searches are to be carried out and the use of technology. The parties may, at any time, apply to the court to seek the determination of an issue concerning disclosure by issuing an application notice.\n\n6.10 The court may also provide disclosure guidance in accordance with paragraph 11.\n\n6.11 Upon the application of the parties/a party, or on its own motion, the court may vary any period of time for a party/the parties to complete a step in disclosure. If the variation is agreed between the parties and will not affect the date set for the Case Management Conference or trial (as appropriate), court approval is not required. 7. Identifying the Issues for Disclosure\n\n7.1 Within 28 days of the final statement of case each party should state, in writing, whether or not it is likely to request search-based Extended Disclosure to include one or more of Models C, D or E (see paragraph 8 below) on one or more Issues for Disclosure in the case. At this point it should not particularise the Model(s) or the issue(s) in the case.\n\n7.2 Where one or more of the parties has indicated it is likely to request search-based Extended Disclosure (i.e. Models C, D and/or E), the claimant must within 42 days of the final statement of case prepare and serve on the other parties a draft List of Issues for Disclosure unless an agreed list of issues for trial already exists and the parties agree that it is suitable (with or without adaptation) to be used for disclosure. The draft List of Issues for Disclosure should be set out in Section 1 A of the Disclosure Review Document.\n\n7.3 At the same time as serving a draft List of Issues for Disclosure, the claimant shall identify for each Issue for Disclosure which Model of Extended Disclosure it proposes for each party. If the claimant proposes Model C Disclosure for any Issue for Disclosure it should indicate, using Section 1 B of the Disclosure Review Document, how the particular documents or narrow class of documents it proposes should be defined for that purpose (see paragraph 8 below).\n\n7.4 If the claimant fails to prepare and serve a List of Issues for Disclosure within 42 days of the final statement of case any defendant may prepare and serve its own draft List of Issues for Disclosure on the other parties together with its proposed Models including any Model C requests.\n\n7.5 A List of Issues for Disclosure is not required if the parties are agreed that Extended Disclosure is to be confined to Models A and B.\n\n7.6 The List of Issues for Disclosure should be as short and concise as possible. \"Issues for Disclosure\" means for the purposes of disclosure only those key issues in dispute, which the parties consider will need to be determined by the court with some reference to contemporaneous documents in order for there to be a fair resolution of the proceedings. It does not extend to every issue which is disputed in the statements of case by denial or non-admission. For the purposes of producing a List of Issues for Disclosure the parties should consider what matters are common ground but should only include the key issues in dispute in the list.\n\n7.7 When drafting Issues for Disclosure the parties should have regard to the primary functions of those Issues namely (i) to help the parties to consider, and the court to determine, whether Extended Disclosure is required and, if so, which Model or Models should be used; (ii) to assist the parties in identifying documents and categories of documents that are likely to exist and require to be disclosed; (iii) to assist those carrying out the disclosure process to do so in a practical and proportionate way including, in the case of search-based disclosure, to help define and guide the searches; (iv) to assist with the process of reviewing documents produced by searches; and (v) to avoid the production of documents that are not relevant to the issues in the proceedings.\n\n7.8 The claimant should seek to ensure that the draft List of Issues for Disclosure provides a fair and balanced summary of the key areas of dispute identified by the parties' statements of case and in respect of which it is likely that one or other of the parties will be seeking search-based Extended Disclosure.\n\n7.9 A party served with a draft List of Issues for Disclosure and proposals on Models shall, as soon as practicable but in any event no later than 21 days from service, indicate using Section 1 A (and, if applicable, 1 B) of the Disclosure Review Document whether it agrees with the proposals (including any proposals as to how Model C Disclosure should be defined). If the party served with the proposals does not agree, or wishes to propose alternative or additional Issues for Disclosure, other Models and/or other Model C proposals, it should set out its alternative or additional proposals in Sections 1 A and 1 B of the Disclosure Review Document.\n\n7.10 In advance of the first case management conference, the parties must discuss and seek to agree the draft List of Issues for Disclosure, the Models identified for each Issue for Disclosure, and the wording of any Model C proposals. They should consider whether any draft Issue for Disclosure can be removed.\n\n7.11 Whilst reasonable and proportionate efforts are required to agree the List of Issues for Disclosure, if agreement cannot be reached after such efforts the List should be concluded by showing the areas of disagreement. The parties should consider seeking Disclosure Guidance from the court at an early stage as a means to help resolve the differences between them. One situation in which Disclosure Guidance should be considered is where one party believes the other is proposing a list of issues that is far too complex to serve as a List of Issues for Disclosure.\n\n7.12 The List of Issues for Disclosure does not bind the parties at trial. The List of Issues for Disclosure need not contain / include a list of all the issues in the case and the issues in the case may develop or be refined as the case proceeds. The List of Issues for Disclosure may be revised or supplemented at any time prior to or following the case management conference, including as a result of statements of case or amended statements of case subsequently served or discussions between the parties in relation to the Disclosure Review Document.",

    "content": "Document: Practice Direction 57AD – Disclosure for the Business and Property Courts\nPart 2 of 3\n==================================================\n7.13 If the parties are (subject to the court) agreed that there are preliminary issues suitable for determination before other issues in the case, or that the case should be divided into stages, the parties may apply to the court before any case management conference for an order for the trial of those issues or for trial in stages (and related directions), and they may agree in writing to limit the work towards disclosure required by this Practice Direction until that application has been heard.\n\n7.14 In an appropriate case where the claimant is acting in person and a defendant is not the court may request the legal representatives of the defendant to lead on the preparation of the List of Issues for Disclosure.\n\n7.15 The parties may agree a revised timetable for completion of the Disclosure Review Document (including the List of Issues for Disclosure, Models and Model C requests) where appropriate, provided always that any such revision to the timetable does not affect the date set for the Case Management Conference.\n\n7.16 In a multi-party case, where the risk of undue complexity in Lists of Issues for Disclosure is heightened, while the provisions of this Practice Direction remain the default arrangement, an application may be made under paragraph 1.11 above to request that the Court order for a bespoke timetable and procedure to be set in order to meet the needs of the multi-party case. 8. The Extended Disclosure Models\n\n8.1 Extended Disclosure may take the form of one or more of the Disclosure Models set out below.\n\n8.2 There is no presumption that a party is entitled to search-based Extended Disclosure (Extended Disclosure Models C, D and/or E). No Model will apply without the approval of the court.\n\n8.3 The court may order that Extended Disclosure be given using different Disclosure Models for different Issues for Disclosure in the case. It is important that there is moderation in the number of Models used and the way in which they are applied to the Issues for Disclosure so that the disclosure process that will follow, using the Models and the Issues for Disclosure, will be practical. In the interests of avoiding undue complexity the court will rarely require different Models for the same set or repository of documents. The court may also order that Extended Disclosure be given by only one party, or that different Models are to apply to each party's Disclosure on a particular Issue for Disclosure. In some cases, it may be appropriate, practical and proportionate for different Models to be applied to different types of documents (e.g. one Model for physical documents and another Model for electronic documents).\n\nModel A: Disclosure confined to known adverse documents\n\nThe court may order that the only disclosure required in relation to some or all of the Issues for Disclosure is of known adverse documents in accordance with the (continuing) duty under paragraph 3.1(2) above.\n\nModel B: Limited Disclosure\n\n(1) The court may order the parties to disclose (where and to the extent that they have not already done so by way of Initial Disclosure, and without limit as to quantity)-\n\n(a) the key documents on which they have relied (expressly or otherwise) in support of the claims or defences advanced in their statement(s) of case; and\n\n(b) the key documents that are necessary to enable the other parties to understand the claim or defence they have to meet;\n\nand in addition to disclose known adverse documents in accordance with their (continuing) duty under paragraph 3.1(2) above.\n\n(2) A party giving Model B Disclosure is under no obligation to undertake a search for documents beyond any search already conducted for the purposes of obtaining advice on its claim or defence or preparing its statement(s) of case. Where it does undertake a search however then the (continuing) duty under paragraph 3.1(2) will apply.\n\nModel C: Disclosure of particular documents or narrow classes of documents\n\n(1) The court may order a party to give disclosure of particular documents or narrow classes of documents relating to a particular Issue for Disclosure, by reference to requests set out in or to be set out in Section 1 B of the Disclosure Review Document or otherwise defined by the court.\n\n(2) If the parties cannot agree that disclosure should be given, or the disclosure to be given, pursuant to a request, then the requesting party must raise the request at the case management conference. The court will determine whether the request is reasonable and proportionate and may either order the disclosing party to search for the documents requested, refuse the request, or order the disclosing party to search for a narrower class of documents than that requested. Any appropriate limits to the scope of the searches to be undertaken will be determined by the court using the information provided in the Disclosure Review Document. A party may address Model C requests not only to the other party or parties, but also propose that Model C be used in respect of documents which it may propose searching for and disclosing.\n\n(3) For the avoidance of doubt, a party giving Model C Disclosure must still comply with the duty under paragraph 3.1(2) above to disclose known adverse documents; these will include any arising from the search directed by the court.\n\nModel D: Narrow search-based disclosure, with or without Narrative Documents\n\n(1) Under Model D, a party shall disclose documents which are likely to support or adversely affect its claim or defence or that of another party in relation to one or more of the Issues for Disclosure.\n\n(2) Each party is required to undertake a reasonable and proportionate search in relation to the Issues for Disclosure for which Model D disclosure has been ordered. Any appropriate limits to the scope of the searches to be undertaken will be determined by the court using the information provided in the Disclosure Review Document.\n\n(3) The court may order the parties to include or exclude Narrative Documents. In the absence of an order, the parties are encouraged to take reasonable steps to exclude Narrative Documents where it is reasonable and proportionate to do so with a view to reducing the overall volume and the cost of any subsequent review by the party receiving the disclosure.\n\n(4) For the avoidance of doubt, a party giving Model D Disclosure must still comply with the duty under paragraph 3.1(2) above to disclose known adverse documents; these will include any arising from the search directed by the court.\n\nModel E: Wide search-based disclosure\n\n(1) Under Model E, a party shall disclose documents which are likely to support or adversely affect its claim or defence or that of another party in relation to one or more of the Issues for Disclosure or which may lead to a train of inquiry which may then result in the identification of other documents for disclosure (because those other documents are likely to support or adversely affect the party's own claim or defence or that of another party in relation to one or more of the Issues for Disclosure).\n\n(2) Model E is only to be ordered in an exceptional case.\n\n(3) Each party is required to undertake a reasonable and proportionate search in relation to the Issues for Disclosure for which Model E Disclosure has been ordered. The scope of the search will be determined by the court using the information provided in the Disclosure Review Document and is likely to be broader than that ordered for Model D Disclosure.\n\n(4) Narrative Documents must also be searched for and disclosed, unless the court otherwise orders.\n\n(5) For the avoidance of doubt, a party giving Model E Disclosure must still comply with the duty under paragraph 3.1(2) above to disclose known adverse documents; these will include any arising from the search directed by the court. 9. Other provisions concerning Disclosure Models\n\n9.1 Where an order for Model B, C, D or E Extended Disclosure is made on one or more Issues for Disclosure, any known adverse documents to be disclosed in compliance with the duty under paragraph 3.1(2) above and not already disclosed must be disclosed at the time ordered for that Extended Disclosure.\n\n9.2 In a case where no order for Extended Disclosure is made in respect of a party on any Issue for Disclosure, that party must still disclose all known adverse documents within 60 days of the first case management conference and provide a Disclosure Certificate certifying that this has been done.\n\n9.3 The provisions of paragraph 8 and this paragraph 9 do not affect the fact that the duty under paragraph 3.1(2) above is a continuing duty as provided by paragraph 3.3 above: if adverse documents in the control of a party come to its knowledge at a later date they must (unless privileged) be disclosed without delay.\n\n9.4 The court may make an order for Extended Disclosure in stages.\n\n9.5 When it is necessary to decide any question of what is reasonable and proportionate under a particular Disclosure Model, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case including the factors set out in paragraph 6.4 above and the overriding objective.\n\n9.6 Where the Disclosure Model requires searches to be undertaken, the parties must discuss and seek to agree, and the court may give directions, on the following matters with a view to reducing the burden and cost of the disclosure exercise-\n\n(1) that the scope of the searches which the disclosing parties are required to undertake be limited to-\n\n(a) particular date ranges and custodians of documents;\n\n(b) particular classes of documents and/or file types;\n\n(c) specific document repositories and/or geographical locations;\n\n(d) specific computer systems or electronic storage devices;\n\n(e) documents responsive to specific keyword searches, or other automated searches (by reference, if appropriate, to individual custodians, creators, repositories, file types and/or date ranges, concepts);\n\n(2) if Narrative Documents are to be excluded, how that is to be achieved in a reasonable and proportionate way;\n\n(3) the use of-\n\n(a) software or analytical tools, including technology assisted review software and techniques;\n\n(b) coding strategies, including to reduce duplication.\n\n(4) prioritisation and workflows.\n\n9.7 In making an order for Extended Disclosure, the court may include any provision that is appropriate including provision for all or any of the following-\n\n(1) requiring the use of specified software or analytical tools;\n\n(2) identifying the methods to be used to identify duplicate or near-duplicate documents and remove or reduce such documents;\n\n(3) requiring the use of data sampling;\n\n(4) specifying the format in which documents are to be disclosed;\n\n(5) identifying the methods that the court regards as sufficient to be used to identify privileged documents and other non-disclosable documents;\n\n(6) the use of a staged approach to the disclosure of electronic documents;\n\n(7) excluding certain classes of document from the disclosure ordered.\n\n9.8 In considering Extended Disclosure as well as when complying with an order for Extended Disclosure the parties should have regard to the guidance set out in Section 3 of the Disclosure Review Document.\n\n9.9 In an appropriate case, the court may order that the question of which party bears the costs of disclosure is to be given separate consideration at a later stage rather than the costs being treated automatically as costs in the case;\n\n9.10 For the avoidance of doubt, Extended Disclosure does not require any document to be translated. 10. Completion of the Disclosure Review Document\n\n10.1 The Disclosure Review Document is the document by which the parties must identify, discuss and seek to agree the scope of any Extended Disclosure sought of Model C, D or E, and provide that information in due course to the court.\n\n10.2 The Disclosure Review Document may be modified (shortened or lengthened) as required in order that key information is exchanged and in due course provided to the court in an efficient, convenient and helpful format. This may include revising some of the questions asked in Section 2 of the DRD or adding others relevant to the particular disclosure exercise to be undertaken. In cases where there is likely to be limited disclosure or the identification and retrieval of documents is straightforward, not every section of the Disclosure Review Document will need to be completed. For such cases, the parties should consider whether it would be more appropriate to use the Less Complex Claims regime.\n\n10.3 The parties' obligation to complete, seek to agree and update the Disclosure Review Document is ongoing. If a party fails to co-operate and constructively to engage in this process the other party or parties may apply to the court for an appropriate order at or separately from the case management conference, and the court may make any appropriate order including the dismissal of any application for Extended Disclosure and/or the adjournment of the case management conference with an adverse order for costs.\n\n10.4 Where Model C is proposed for any Issue(s) for Disclosure, these should be limited in number, focused in scope and concise so that the responding party may be clear as to the particular document(s) or narrow classes of document relating to a particular Issue for Disclosure for which it is being asked to undertake searches. Broad and wide-ranging formulations such as \"any or all documents relating to…\" should not be used. Model C requests should not be used in a tactical or oppressive way.\n\n10.5 Having sought to agree the List of Issues for Disclosure, proposals on Model(s) for Extended Disclosure and the wording of any Model C requests, the parties should prepare and exchange drafts of Section 2 of the Disclosure Review Document (including costs estimates of different proposals, and where possible estimates of likely amount of documents involved) as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event not later than 14 days before the case management conference. Section 2 of the Disclosure Review Document should be completed only if any party is seeking an order for search-based Extended Disclosure (i.e. Models C, D and/or E).\n\n10.6 The parties must seek to resolve any disputes over the scope of any Extended Disclosure sought in advance of the first case management conference. Any disputes which have not been resolved will normally be decided by the court at the first case management conference.\n\n10.7 A finalised single joint Disclosure Review Document should be filed by the claimant not later than 5 days before the case management conference. Related correspondence and earlier drafts should not ordinarily be filed.\n\n10.8 The parties must each file and serve a signed Certificate of Compliance substantially in the form set out in Appendix 3 not less than two days before the case management conference. A Certificate of Compliance is not required for cases where a Disclosure Review Document has been dispensed with under paragraph 10.5.\n\n10.9 In an appropriate case where the claimant is acting in person and a defendant is not the court may request the legal representatives of the defendant to lead on the preparation and filing of the Disclosure Review Document. 11. Disclosure Guidance\n\n11.1 A party may seek guidance from the court on any point concerning the operation of this Practice Direction in a particular case, where-\n\n(1) there is a significant difference of approach between the parties;\n\n(2) the parties require guidance from the court in order to address the point of difference between them without a formal determination; and\n\n(3) the point is suitable for guidance to be provided either on the papers or, other than in substantial claims, within the maximum hearing length and maximum time for pre-reading provided at paragraph 11.2.\n\n11.2 Disclosure Guidance may be obtained by issuing an application notice. The application notice should contain a statement identifying the point upon which guidance is sought and confirming the matters at (1) to (3) of paragraph 11.1 above. Evidence will not normally be required for Disclosure Guidance . If a hearing is requested, or is fixed by the court, the application will ordinarily have a maximum hearing length of 60 minutes and a maximum time of 30 minutes for pre-reading. However, where suitable the Court may decide to deal with the application on the documents and without an oral hearing. The Court may also direct a longer maximum hearing length or time for pre-reading, if it is required.\n\n11.3 At a hearing the court will generally expect a legal representative with direct responsibility for the conduct of disclosure to be the person who participates on behalf of each party in the discussion.\n\n11.4 The guidance given by the court will be recorded in a short note, to be approved by the court. Whilst the primary function of Disclosure Guidance is to provide guidance (see paragraph 11.1(2) above), for the avoidance of doubt the court may, where it considers it is appropriate to do so, make an order.\n\n11.5 Unless otherwise ordered, the costs of an application for Disclosure Guidance are costs in the case and no order from the court to that effect is required.\n\n11.6 The provisions in this paragraph do not affect or limit the court's jurisdiction to determine any point about the scope of disclosure, the application of any provision in this Practice Direction or the effect of any order made by the court. A party may apply to the court seeking the determination of an issue about disclosure at any time (see paragraphs 6.8 to 6.11 above). 12. Complying with an order for Extended Disclosure\n\n12.1 An order for Extended Disclosure is complied with by undertaking the following steps-\n\n(1) service of a Disclosure Certificate substantially in the form set out in Appendix 4 signed by the party giving disclosure, to include a statement supported by a statement of truth signed by the party or an appropriate person at the party that all known adverse documents have been disclosed;\n\n(2) service of an Extended Disclosure List of Documents (unless dispensed with, by agreement or order); and\n\n(3) production of the documents which are disclosed over which no claim is made to withhold production or (if the party cannot produce a particular document) compliance with paragraph 12.3.\n\n12.2 The order for Extended Disclosure will not have been complied with until each step specified in paragraph 12.1 has taken place.\n\n12.3 If a party cannot produce a particular document (because the document no longer exists, the party no longer has it in its possession or for any other reason) the disclosing party is required to describe each such document with reasonable precision and explain with reasonable precision the circumstances in which, and the date when, the document ceased to exist or left its possession or the other reason for non-production. If it is not possible to identify individual documents, the class of documents must be described with reasonable precision.\n\n12.4 In the case of a company, firm, association or other organisation, or where the Disclosure Certificate is signed by a party on behalf of other parties, the certificate must-\n\n(1) identify the person signing the Disclosure Certificate; and\n\n(2) explain why she or he is considered to be an appropriate person to sign it.\n\n12.5 A party may not without the permission of the court or agreement of the parties rely on any document in its control that it has not disclosed at the time required for Extended Disclosure (or within 60 days after the first case management conference in a case where there will be no Extended Disclosure). For the avoidance of doubt the party and its legal representatives remain under the duties under paragraph 3.1 (the Disclosure Duties) and 3.2 above.\n\n12.6 A Disclosure Certificate may be signed by the legal representative for the party concerned, provided always that the legal representative has explained the significance of the Disclosure Certificate to his or her client(s) and has been given written authority to sign the Disclosure Certificate on the client(s) behalf. In such cases, the party will be deemed to have agreed to and be bound by the certifications given by its legal representative. 13. Production of documents\n\n13.1 Save where otherwise agreed or ordered, a party shall produce-\n\n(1) disclosable electronic documents to the other parties by providing electronic copies in the documents' native format, in a manner which preserves metadata; and\n\n(2) (save as provided by paragraph 5.5 above in the case of Initial Disclosure) disclosable hard copy documents by providing scanned versions or photocopied hard copies.\n\n13.2 Electronic documents should generally be provided in the form which allows the party receiving the documents the same ability to access, search, review and display the documents (including metadata) as the party providing them.\n\n13.3 A party should provide any available searchable OCR versions of electronic documents with the original, unless they have been redacted. If OCR versions are provided, they are provided on an \"as is\" basis, with no assurance to the other party that the OCR versions are complete or accurate.\n\n13.4 A party should not disclose more than one copy of a document unless additional copies contain or bear modifications, obliterations or other markings or features which of themselves cause those additional copies to fall within a party's Initial or Extended Disclosure obligations.\n\n13.5 In multi-party cases, the parties should discuss and seek to agree whether it is appropriate for all of the disclosing party's documents to be given to all of the other parties or to some only. In the event of disagreement, the parties may seek Disclosure Guidance from the Court pursuant to paragraph 11 or, if appropriate, apply by application notice to the court for directions. 14. Right to withhold production of documents (other than public interest immunity)\n\n14.1 A person who wishes to claim a right or duty (other than on the basis of public interest immunity) to withhold disclosure or production of a document, or part of a document, or a class of documents which would otherwise fall within its obligations of Initial Disclosure or Extended Disclosure may exercise that right or duty without making an application to the court subject to-\n\n(1) describing the document, part of a document or class of document; and\n\n(2) explaining, in the Disclosure Certificate, the grounds upon which the right or duty is being exercised.\n\nA claim to privilege may (unless the court otherwise orders) be made in a form that treats privileged documents as a class, provided always that paragraph 3.2(5) is complied with.\n\n14.2 A party who wishes to challenge the exercise of a right or duty to withhold disclosure or production must apply to the court by application notice supported where necessary by a witness statement.\n\n14.3 The court may inspect the document or samples of the class of documents if that is necessary to determine whether the claimed right or duty exists or the scope of that right or duty. 15. Confidentiality\n\nIf there are material concerns over the confidentiality of a document (whether the confidentiality benefits a party to the proceedings or a third party), the court may order disclosure to a limited class of persons, upon such terms and subject to such conditions as it thinks fit. The court may make further orders upon the request of a party, or on its own initiative, varying the class of persons, or varying the terms and conditions previously ordered, or removing any limitation on disclosure. 16. Redaction\n\n16.1 A party may redact a part or parts of a document on the ground that the redacted data comprises data that is-\n\n(1) irrelevant to any issue in the proceedings, and confidential; or\n\n(2) privileged.\n\n16.2 Any redaction must be accompanied by an explanation of the basis on which it has been undertaken and confirmation, where a legal representative has conduct of litigation for the redacting party, that the redaction has been reviewed by a legal representative with control of the disclosure process. A party wishing to challenge the redaction of data must apply to the court by application notice supported where necessary by a witness statement. 17. Failure adequately to comply with an order for Extended Disclosure\n\n17.1 Where there has been or may have been a failure adequately to comply with an order for Extended Disclosure the court may make such further orders as may be appropriate, including an order requiring a party to-\n\n(1) serve a further, or revised, Disclosure Certificate;\n\n(2) undertake further steps, including further or more extended searches, to ensure compliance with an order for Extended Disclosure;\n\n(3) provide a further or improved Extended Disclosure List of Documents;\n\n(4) produce documents; or\n\n(5) make a witness statement explaining any matter relating to disclosure.\n\n17.2 The party applying for an order under paragraph 17.1 must satisfy the court that making an order is reasonable and proportionate (as defined in paragraph 6.4).\n\n17.3 An application for any order under paragraph 17.1 should normally be supported by a witness statement. 18. Varying an order for Extended Disclosure; making an additional order for disclosure of specific documents\n\n18.1 The court may at any stage make an order that varies an order for Extended Disclosure. This includes making an additional order for disclosure of specific documents or narrow classes of documents relating to a particular Issue for Disclosure.\n\n18.2 The party applying for an order under paragraph 18.1 must satisfy the court that varying the original order for Extended Disclosure is necessary for the just disposal of the proceedings and is reasonable and proportionate (as defined in paragraph 6.4).\n\n18.3 An application for an order under paragraph 18.1 must be supported by a witness statement explaining the circumstances in which the original order for Extended Disclosure was made and why it is considered that order should be varied.\n\n18.4 The court's powers under this paragraph include, but are not limited to, making an order for disclosure in the form of Models A to E and requiring a party to make a witness statement explaining any matter relating to disclosure. 19. Restriction on use of a privileged document which has been inadvertently produced\n\n19.1 Where a party inadvertently produces a privileged document, the party who has received the document may use it or its contents only with the permission of the court.\n\n19.2 Where a party is told, or has reason to suspect, that a document has been produced to it inadvertently, that party shall not read the document and shall promptly notify the party who produced it to him. If that party confirms that the document was produced inadvertently, the receiving party shall, unless on application the court otherwise orders, either return it or destroy it, as directed by the producing party, without reading it. 20. Sanctions\n\n20.1 Throughout disclosure the court retains its full powers of case management and the full range of sanctions available to it.\n\n20.2 If a party has failed to comply with its obligations under this Practice Direction including by-\n\n(1) failing to comply with any procedural step required to be taken;\n\n(2) failing to discharge its Disclosure Duties; or\n\n(3) failing to cooperate with the other parties, including in the process of seeking to complete, agree and update the Disclosure Review Document,\n\nthe court may adjourn any hearing, make an adverse order for costs or order that any further disclosure by a party be conditional on any matter the court shall specify. This provision does not limit the court's power to deal with the failure as a contempt of court in an appropriate case. 21. Documents referred to in evidence\n\n21.1 A party may at any time request a copy of a document which has not already been provided by way of disclosure but is mentioned in-\n\n(1) a statement of case;\n\n(2) a witness statement;\n\n(3) a witness summary;\n\n(4) an affidavit; or\n\n(5) an expert's report.\n\n21.2 Copies of documents mentioned in a statement of case, witness evidence or an expert's report and requested in writing should be provided by agreement unless the request is unreasonable or a right to withhold production is claimed.\n\n21.3 A document is mentioned where it is referred to, cited in whole or in part or there is a direct allusion to it.",

    "content": "Document: Practice Direction 57AD – Disclosure for the Business and Property Courts\nSection: Step 7\nPart 3 of 3\n==================================================\n21.4 Subject to rule 35.10(4), the court may make an order requiring a document to be produced if it is satisfied such an order is reasonable and proportionate (as defined in paragraph 6.4). 22. Cost\n\n22.1 The parties are required to provide an estimate of what they consider to be the likely costs of giving the disclosure proposed by them in the Disclosure Review Document, and the likely volume of documents involved, in order that a court may consider whether such proposals on disclosure are reasonable and proportionate (as defined in paragraph 6.4). These estimated costs may be used by the court in the cost budgeting process.\n\n22.2 In cases where the cost budgeting scheme applies, if it is not practical to complete the disclosure section of Form H in relation to disclosure prior to the court making an order in relation to disclosure at the case management conference, the parties may notify the court that they have agreed to postpone completion of that section of Form H until after the case management conference. If they have agreed to postpone they must complete the disclosure section within such period as is ordered by the court after an order for disclosure has been made at the case management conference. Where possible the court will then consider (and if appropriate, approve) that part of the cost budget without an oral hearing. 23. False Disclosure Certificates\n\n23.1 Proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against a person who signs, or causes to be signed by another person, a false Disclosure Certificate without an honest belief in its truth.\n\nSECTION II (text of rules from Part 31) Disclosure before proceedings start\n\n31.16.-(1) This rule applies where an application is made to the court under any Act for disclosure before proceedings have started.\n\n(2) The application must be supported by evidence.\n\n(3) The court may make an order under this rule only where-(a) the respondent is likely to be a party to subsequent proceedings;(b) the applicant is also likely to be a party to those proceedings;(c) if proceedings had started, the respondent's duty by way of standard disclosure, set out in rule 31.6, would extend to the documents or classes of documents of which the applicant seeks disclosure; and(d) disclosure before proceedings have started is desirable in order to-(i) dispose fairly of the anticipated proceedings;(ii) assist the dispute to be resolved without proceedings; or(iii) save costs.\n\n(4) An order under this rule must-(a) specify the documents or the classes of documents which the respondent must disclose; and(b) require him, when making disclosure, to specify any of those documents-(i) which are no longer in his control; or(ii) in respect of which he claims a right or duty to withhold inspection.\n\n(5) Such an order may-(a) require the respondent to indicate what has happened to any documents which are no longer in his control; and(b) specify the time and place for disclosure and inspection. Orders for disclosure against a person not a party\n\n31.17.-(1) This rule applies where an application is made to the court under any Act for disclosure by a person who is not a party to the proceedings.\n\n(2) The application must be supported by evidence.\n\n(3) The court may make an order under this rule only where-\n\n(a) the documents of which disclosure is sought are likely to support the case of the applicant or adversely affect the case of one of the other parties to the proceedings; and\n\n(b) disclosure is necessary in order to dispose fairly of the proceedings or to save costs.\n\n(4) An order under this rule must-\n\n(a) specify the documents or the classes of documents which the respondent must disclose; and\n\n(b) require the respondent, when making disclosure, to specify any of those documents-\n\n(i) which are no longer in his control; or\n\n(ii) in respect of which he claims a right or duty to withhold inspection.\n\n(5) Such an order may-\n\n(a) require the respondent to indicate what has happened to any documents which are no longer in his control; and(b) specify the time and place for disclosure and inspection. Rules not to limit other powers of the court to order disclosure\n\n31.18.-Rules 31.16 and 31.17 do not limit any other power which the court may have to order-\n\n(a) disclosure before proceedings have started; and\n\n(b) disclosure against a person who is not a party to proceedings. Claim to withhold inspection or disclosure of a document (public interest immunity)\n\n31.19.-(1) A person may apply, without notice, for an order permitting him to withhold disclosure of a document on the ground that disclosure would damage the public interest.\n\n(2) Unless the court orders otherwise, an order of the court under paragraph (1)-\n\n(a) must not be served on any other person; and\n\n(b) must not be open to inspection by any person.…\n\n(8) This Part does not affect any rule of law which permits or requires a document to be withheld from disclosure or inspection on the ground that its disclosure or inspection would damage the public interest. Subsequent use of disclosed documents and completed Electronic Documents Questionnaires\n\n31.22.-(1) A party to whom a document has been disclosed may use the document only for the purpose of the proceedings in which it is disclosed, except where-(a) the document has been read to or by the court, or referred to, at a hearing which has been held in public;\n\n(b) the court gives permission; or(c) the party who disclosed the document and the person to whom the document belongs agree.\n\n(2) The court may make an order restricting or prohibiting the use of a document which has been disclosed, even where the document has been read to or by the court, or referred to, at a hearing which has been held in public.\n\n(3) An application for such an order may be made-(a) by a party; or(b) by any person to whom the document belongs.\n\n(4) For the purpose of this rule, an Electronic Documents Questionnaire which has been completed and served by another party pursuant Appendix 1: Definitions for the purpose of Section I\n\n1.1 \"Control\" in the context of disclosure includes documents: (a) which are or were in a party's physical possession; (b) in respect of which a party has or has had a right to possession; or (c) in respect of which a party has or has had a right to inspect or take copies.\n\n1.2 \"Copy\" means a facsimile of a document either in the same format as the document being copied or in a similar format that is readable by the recipient, and in all cases having identical content.\n\n1.3 \"Data Sampling\" means the process of checking data by identifying and checking representative individual documents.\n\n1.4 \"Disclose\" comprises a party stating that a document that is or was in its control has been identified or forms part of an identified class of documents and either producing a copy, or stating why a copy will not be produced.\n\n1.5 \"Disclosure Certificate\" means a certificate that is substantially in the form set out in Appendix 3 and signed in accordance with the Practice Direction.\n\n1.6 \"Disclosure Review Document\" means as the case may be the Disclosure Review Document at Appendix 2, or in the case of Less Complex Claims the Disclosure Review Document at Appendix 6, which is to be completed by the parties pursuant to the Practice Direction, in respect of any application for Extended Disclosure.\n\n1.7 \"Electronic Image\" means an electronic representation of a paper document.\n\n1.8 \"Keyword Search\" means a software-aided search for words across the text of an electronic document.\n\n1.9 \"Less Complex Claim\" means a claim which the parties have agreed or the Court has ordered is one that meets the criteria for the Less Complex Claims regime as set out in Appendix 5 of this Practice Direction.\n\n1.10 \"List of Documents\" means a list of documents in chronological order (or if appropriate classes of documents in chronological order), identifying each document with a clear description including the date and, where applicable any author, sender or recipient. Where appropriate the list must distinguish between documents which exist and those that no longer exist.\n\n1.11 \"Metadata\" means data about data. In the case of an electronic document, metadata is typically embedded information about the document which is not readily accessible once the native electronic document has been converted into an electronic image or paper document. It may include (for example) the date and time of creation or modification of a word-processing file, or the author and the date and time of sending an e-mail. Metadata may be created automatically by a computer system or manually by a user.\n\n1.12 \"Narrative Document\" means a document which is relevant only to the background or context of material facts or events, and not directly to the Issues for Disclosure; for the avoidance of doubt an adverse document (as defined at paragraph 2.6) is not to be treated as a Narrative Document\n\n1.13 \"Native Electronic Document\" or \"Native Format\" means an electronic document stored in the original form in which it was created by a computer software program;\n\n1.14 \"Optical Character Recognition\" (OCR) means the computer-facilitated recognition of printed or written text characters in an electronic image in which the text-based contents cannot be searched electronically.\n\n1.15 \"Technology Assisted Review\" includes all forms of document review that may be undertaken or assisted by the use of technology, including but not limited to predictive coding and computer assisted review. Appendix 2: Disclosure Review Document\n\nDisclosure Review Document(PDF) Appendix 3: Certificate of Compliance\n\nAppendix 3 to Practice Direction 57 AD\n\nCertificate of Compliance (represented parties)\n\nBy submitting the disclosure review document to the court, I hereby confirm that I have discussed, explained and advised my client on the following:\n\n• The alternative orders that can be made by the court in relation to disclosure, including the question of whether or not an order for Extended Disclosure should be sought at all and, if so, what the Issues for Disclosure should be and which of the Disclosure Models are appropriate to achieve a fair determination of those Issues for Disclosure;\n• The duties that I and my client are under in relation to disclosure pursuant to paragraph 3 of Practice Direction 57 AD;\n• The overriding objective in all cases to seek to ensure that the burden and costs of disclosure are reasonable and proportionate in the context of the proceedings.\n• The likely costs that will be incurred in respect of the disclosure orders sought.\n\nI further confirm that the information provided in this disclosure review document is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true and accurate.\n\nName: ……………………………………..\n\nPosition: ……………………………………..\n\n[Claimant / Defendant]\n\nCertificate of Compliance (unrepresented parties)\n\nBy submitting the disclosure review document to the court, I hereby confirm as follows:\n\n• I understand the duties that I am under in relation to disclosure pursuant to paragraph 3 of Practice Direction 57 AD.\n• I am aware of the overriding objective in all cases to seek to ensure that the burden and costs of disclosure are reasonable and proportionate in the context of the proceedings.\n• The information provided in this DRD is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true and accurate.\n\nName: ……………………………………..\n\nPosition: ……………………………………..\n\n[Claimant / Defendant] Appendix 4: Disclosure Certificate\n\nDisclosure Certificate(PDF) Appendix 5: Less complex claims\n\n1.This appendix contains provisions for a simplified disclosure regime for Less Complex Claims. All the provisions of the main body of Practice Direction 57 AD on disclosure in the Business and Property Courts apply to Less Complex Claims, including the provisions relating to Initial Disclosure in accordance with paragraph 5 of Practice Direction 57 AD, unless they are expressly varied by this appendix or are required to be applied with appropriate changes as a consequence of its provisions.\n\n2.Parties to a dispute should always consider whether a dispute or claim is suitable for the Shorter Trials Scheme rather than being treated as a Less Complex Claim.\n\nDesignating claims as Less Complex Claims\n\n3.A Less Complex Claim is a claim which by virtue of its nature, value, complexity and the likely volume of Extended Disclosure may not benefit from the full procedure set out in the main body of Practice Direction 57 AD. The value of a claim means a reasonable estimate, made in good faith, of the total financial value at risk in the claim taken with the value, so far as ascertainable, of any non-financial relief sought.\n\n4.If the value of a claim is less than £1,000,000 then unless the other factors specified in paragraph 3 above indicate to the contrary, the claim should be treated as a Less Complex Claim. The fact that the value of a claim may exceed £1,000,000 does not, of itself, mean that the claim should not be treated as a Less Complex Claim if the other factors specified in paragraph 3 above indicate that it should be.\n\n5.A claim may be treated as a Less Complex Claim for the purposes of Extended Disclosure either by an agreement made between all the parties to the claim or by order of the court.\n\n6.An agreement to treat a claim as a Less Complex Claim may be made between parties before or after a claim is issued and these provisions may be used in respect of existing as well as new proceedings. If an agreement is reached before a claim is issued it takes effect upon service of the claim on the parties to the agreement. An agreement between the parties may not vary the provisions for Extended Disclosure contained in this appendix, unless approved by court order.\n\n7.If there is no agreement between the parties before the claim is issued, the claimant may by letter or in its particulars of claim notify the defendant that it wishes the claim to be treated as a Less Complex Claim. If no such notification is given by the claimant, a defendant may by letter or in its defence notify the claimant that it wishes to treat the claim as a Less Complex Claim.\n\n8.A request to treat a claim as a Less Complex Claim must include brief reasons for believing that the claim meets the criteria specified in paragraph 3 of this appendix.\n\n9.If the parties acting reasonably and in good faith do not agree to the claim being treated as a Less Complex Claim, the provisions of this appendix shall not apply unless the court makes an order to the contrary. The court may make such an order of its own volition or upon determining an application made by application notice. The application notice must contain or be accompanied by a fair summary of the parties' competing contentions in relation to the application of the criteria specified in paragraph 3 of this appendix and copies of any relevant correspondence. Where possible, the court will make a determination in writing without a hearing.\n\nSimplified procedure for Less Complex Claims\n\n10.Where the parties have agreed that this appendix shall apply to the claim, or the court has so ordered, the provisions in the main body of Practice Direction 57 AD shall be varied and shall operate as follows:\n\n10.1 Extended Disclosure will be given using only Models A, B or D. Models C and E are not available for use in a Less Complex Claim.\n\n10.2 The parties shall complete a disclosure review document in the form set out in Appendix 6 in accordance with the timetable contained within paragraphs 7 and 10 of Practice Direction 57 AD and Appendix 7.\n\n10.3 As provided for in paragraphs 7.1 and 10.1 of Practice Direction 57 AD, if none of the parties are requesting search-based Extended Disclosure (ie Model D), but instead are only proposing Models A and/or B, then the provisions in Appendices 5, 6 and 7 shall not apply (unless the court orders to the contrary) and there shall be no requirement to identify the Issues for Disclosure or to complete a Disclosure Review Document, although the parties may agree to do so if they consider this will assist.\n\n10.4\"Issues for Disclosure\" has the same meaning as in paragraph 7.6 of Practice Direction 57 AD. However, the definition is to be applied with the following additional guidance. Issues for Disclosure in a Less Complex Claim must be brief and be drafted at a high level of abstraction. Only rarely should the number of Issues for Disclosure exceed five and they should not be defined by reference to sub-issues if that will materially increase the length and complexity of the List of Issues for Disclosure.\n\n10.5 When drafting Issues for Disclosure the parties should have regard to the primary functions of those Issues namely (i) to help the parties to consider, and the court to determine, whether Extended Disclosure is required and, if so, which Model or Models should be used; (ii) to assist the parties in identifying documents and categories of documents that are likely to exist and require to be disclosed; (iii) to assist those carrying out the disclosure process to do so in a practical and proportionate way including, in the case of search-based disclosure, to help define and guide the searches; (iv) to assist with the process of reviewing documents produced by searches; and (v) to avoid the production of documents that are not relevant to the issues in the proceedings.\n\n10.6 The parties may use issues for trial as a starting point for defining Issues for Disclosure but it is not the function of Issues for Disclosure to replace issues for trial.\n\n10.7 The parties must discuss and seek to agree the draft List of issues for Disclosure in advance of the date fixed for the first case management conference.\n\n10.8 The parties must at all times have regard to their duties under paragraph 3 (in particular the duty placed upon legal representatives under paragraph 3.2(3)) of Practice Direction 57 AD and their duty to assist the court to further the overriding objective, in particular to deal with the claim at proportionate cost. The parties should recognise that there may be genuine differences of view about whether Extended Disclosure should be ordered and, if so, what order should be made. If the parties are unable to agree the terms of an order for Extended Disclosure after reasonable engagement between them, brief submissions on the differences of approach should be made to the court at the case management conference and the court requested to make a determination.\n\n11.For the avoidance of doubt, all provisions in the main body of Practice Direction 57 AD regarding Known Adverse Documents apply to Less Complex Claims. Appendix 6: Disclosure Review Document for Extended Disclosure in Less Complex Claims\n\nDisclosure Review Document for Extended Disclosure in Less Complex Claims(PDF) Appendix 7: Explanatory notes for the Disclosure Review Document for Extended Disclosure in Less Complex Claims\n\n• The Less Complex Claims Disclosure Review Document (\"LCCDRD\") is intended to:facilitate the exchange of information and provide a framework for discussions about the scope of Extended Disclosure;help the parties to agree a sensible and cost-effective approach to Extended Disclosure for Models A, B and/or D and identify areas of disagreement; andprovide the court with parties' proposals on Extended Disclosure for Models A, B and/or D, agreed or otherwise, so that the court can make appropriate case management decisions at the case management conference.\n• These explanatory notes provide guidance. While not all of this guidance will be suitable for every claim, parties are nevertheless encouraged to follow this guidance unless there are good reasons not to do so.\n• Unless stated otherwise below, the explanation and guidance in the Introduction of the Explanatory notes for Disclosure Review Document in Appendix 2 will apply for the completion of this form. If an order for Extended Disclosure is made by the court, the parties may also find it helpful to refer to the \"Guidance on process after any order for Extended Disclosure has been made\", which is also in Appendix 2.\n• References to paragraph numbers in the LCCDRD are to the paragraphs in Appendix 5 to Practice Direction 57 AD(the \"Practice Direction\") unless stated otherwise and if there is a conflict between the LCCDRD and the Practice Direction, the Practice Direction will prevail.\n• The LCCDRD only needs to be completed where one or more of the parties are seeking Extended Disclosure in a Less Complex Claim. Parties do not need to complete a LCCDRD in Less Complex Claims where only Model A or B or no Extended Disclosure is sought by the parties. Where only Model B is requested, if the parties consider that it would nevertheless assist to identify and seek to agree upon a List of Issues for Disclosure or to complete any other sections of the LCCDRD, the parties may agree to do so.\n• Unless agreed by the parties or ordered otherwise by the court, the claimant(s) will be responsible for ensuring that the form is completed and a single agreed version is filed with the court. If the claimant(s) is not seeking any search-based Disclosure (i.e. Model D disclosure) but one or more of the defendants is, the parties may agree that the defendant(s) shall be responsible for producing the LCCDRD and ensuring that the form is filed with the court. If there is more than one defendant, the parties should seek to agree which defendant shall bear this responsibility for the form.\n• The parties must seek to agree and complete a List of Issues for Disclosure. Apart from the List of Issues for Disclosure in section 1, which must be completed in all cases where a LCCDRD is required under paragraph 10.1 of Appendix 5 to the Practice Direction, the parties are not required to complete all of the other sections of the form. They only should complete the sections which are applicable and relevant to the disclosure being requested in the particular case. This should as a minimum include the key information which the parties consider would assist the court in deciding what disclosure to order in the case.\n• If the parties agree that any of the sections in the form are not applicable or relevant at all to the case, they should leave the response box next to those sections blank. If the parties cannot agree on whether a section is not applicable or is irrelevant, or if a section is only not applicable to a particular party or to a particular extent, they should include the wording \"Not applicable\" next to that section and a brief explanation, in order to assist the court in understanding the parties' positions and in its review of the form.\n• The parties are encouraged to confer (in person or by phone or video conference) and seek to agree the contents of the LCCDRD as it applies to their disclosure, in advance of the case management conference. Extensive correspondence in relation to the LCCDRD is unlikely to be efficient or helpful.\n• If the parties cannot agree on any aspects of the LCCDRD (including the List of Issues for Disclosure) this should be recorded in summary form in section 6. The parties may also apply if appropriate for guidance from the court under paragraph 11 of the Practice Direction in order to seek to resolve any differences in advance of the case management conference.\n• The fact that a party may propose initial searches (including keyword searches) at the stage of completing the LCCDRD should not be taken as acceptance by that party that those searches should ultimately be used (particularly if, on testing the keyword searches against the available data, it provides false positive results).\n• If it is not practicable to provide a list of keywords for searches prior to the case management conference, the parties should engage and seek to co-operate following the case management conference to identify and agree the key words they propose using and thereafter test those key words against the data to determine whether or not they are appropriate.\n\n• facilitate the exchange of information and provide a framework for discussions about the scope of Extended Disclosure;\n• help the parties to agree a sensible and cost-effective approach to Extended Disclosure for Models A, B and/or D and identify areas of disagreement; and\n• provide the court with parties' proposals on Extended Disclosure for Models A, B and/or D, agreed or otherwise, so that the court can make appropriate case management decisions at the case management conference.\n\nTimetable for completing the LCCDRD\n\n• The timetable for completion of the LCCDRD is set out in paragraphs 7 and 10 of the Practice Direction. The parties may agree a revised timetable for completion of the LCCDRD (including the List of Issues for Disclosure and Models) where appropriate, provided always that any such revision to the timetable does not affect the date set for the Case Management Conference. For convenience the timetable is summarised below as follows:\n\nStage to be completed\n\nDeadline\n\nStep 1\n\nEach party should state, in writing, whether or not it is likely to request Extended Disclosure Models A, B and/or D on one or more issues in the case. At this point it should not particularise the Model(s) or the issue(s) in the case.\n\nWithin 28 days of the closure of statements of case\n\nStep 2\n\nWhere one or more of the parties has indicated it is likely to request search-based Extended Disclosure (i.e. Models D), unless the parties agree otherwise, the claimant must prepare and serve on the other parties a draft List of Issues for Disclosure unless the equivalent of such a list has already been agreed between the parties (for example, as part of a fuller list of issues).\n\nAt the same time, the claimant shall identify for each Issue for Disclosure which Model of Extended Disclosure it proposes for each party.\n\nIf the claimant fails to take these steps, the defendant may, but is not obliged to, prepare and serve its own draft List of Issues for Disclosure on the other parties.\n\nWithin 42 days of the closure of statements of case\n\nStep 3\n\nA party served with a draft List of Issues for Disclosure and proposals on Models shall indicate within section 1 of the LCCDRD whether it agrees with the proposed Issues for Disclosure and corresponding Model(s) for Extended Disclosure by completing the \"Issue Agreed\" and \"Model Agreed\" columns in section 1.\n\nIf the party does not agree, or wishes to propose alternative or additional Issues for Disclosure or other Models, it should set out its alternative or additional proposals in section 1 of the LCCDRD and briefly explain and set out in section 6 of the LCCDRD the reasons why it disagrees with the Issues for Disclosure or Models proposals of the other party the reasons for the alternative proposals it is proposing.\n\nAs soon as practicable but in any event no later than 21 days after service of the draft List of Issues for Disclosure\n\nStep 4\n\nHaving sought to agree the List of Issues for Disclosure and proposals on Model(s) for Extended Disclosure, the parties should prepare and exchange drafts of the LCCDRD (with all applicable sections of the document completed) in accordance with the guidance in Appendix 7.\n\nAs soon as reasonably practicable and in any event not later than 14 days before the case management conference\n\nStep 5\n\nThe parties must seek to resolve any disputes over the scope of any Extended Disclosure sought or any other aspect of the completion of the LCCDRD.\n\nIn advance of the first case management conference\n\nStep 6\n\nUnless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the court, the claimant(s) shall be responsible for ensuring that the form is completed and a single agreed version is filed with the court. Related correspondence and earlier drafts should not ordinarily be filed.\n\nNot later than 5 days before the first case management conference\n\nStep 7\n\nThe parties must independently file a signed Certificate of Compliance substantially in the form set out in Appendix 3 to the Practice Direction.\n\nNot less than two days before the case management conference",

and\n\n(2) if he does not order a pre-trial review, he may on his own initiative give directions for the further preparation of the case or as to the conduct of the trial.\n\n---\n\n8.4\n\nAt a pre-trial review -\n\n(1) the parties should if possible be represented by the advocates who will be appearing at the trial;\n\n(2) any representatives appearing must be fully informed and authorised for the purposes of the review; and\n\n(3) the court will give such directions for the conduct of the trial as it sees fit.\n\nEvidence for applications\n\n---\n\n9.1\n\nThe general requirement is that, unless the court orders otherwise -\n\n(1) evidence in support of an application must be filed and served with the application: see rule 23.7(3);\n\n(2) evidence in answer must be filed and served within 14 days after the application is served;\n\n(3) evidence in reply must be filed and served within 7 days of the service of the evidence in answer.\n\n---\n\n9.2\n\nIn any case in which the application is likely to require an oral hearing of more than half a day the periods set out in paragraphs 9.1(2) and (3) will be 28 days and 14 days respectively.\n\n9.3\n\nIf the date fixed for the hearing of the application means that the times in paragraphs 9.1(2) and (3) cannot both be achieved, the evidence must be filed and served -\n\n(1) as soon as possible; and\n\n(2) in sufficient time to ensure that the application may fairly proceed on the date fixed.\n\n---\n\n9.4\n\nThe parties may, in accordance with rule 2.11, agree different periods from those provided above, provided that the agreement does not affect the ability to proceed on the date fixed for the hearing of the application.\n\nFiles for applications\n\n---\n\n10.\n\nBefore the hearing of any application, the applicant must -\n\n(1) provide to the court and each other party an appropriate indexed file for the application with consecutively numbered pages; and\n\n(2) attach to the file an estimate of the reading time required by the judge.\n\nJudgments and orders\n\n11.1\n\nAfter any hearing the claimant must draw up a draft order, unless the decision was made on the application of another party in which case that party must do so.\n\n---\n\n11.2\n\nA draft order must be submitted by the party responsible for drawing it up within 3 clear days of the decision, with sufficient copies for each party and for one to be retained by the court.\n\n11.3\n\nThe sealed orders will be returned to the party submitting them, who will be responsible for serving the order on the other parties.\n\n11.4\n\nOrders must be dated with the date of the decision, except for consent orders submitted for approval, which must be left undated.\n\n---\n\nAnnex A\n\nCase Management Information Sheet - Circuit Commercial Courts (PDF - opens in new window)\n\nAnnex B\n\nStandard Directions in Circuit Commercial Courts (PDF - opens in new window)\n\nAnnex C\n\nPre-trial Check List - Circuit Commercial Courts (PDF - opens in new window)",

Similarly, the examples are not exhaustive and other types of claim may be appropriate to this specialist list.\n\n---\n\nHow to start a TCC claim\n\n3.1 TCC claims must be issued in the High Court or in a County Court hearing centre specified in this practice direction.\n\n3.2 The claim form must be marked in the top right hand corner 'Technology and Construction Court (KBD)' below the words 'In the High Court of Justice, Business and Property Courts [in/of ]'. In the County Court the claim form must be marked \"Business and Property Courts work\".\n\n3.3 TCC claims brought in the High Court outside London may be issued in any district registry, but it is preferable that wherever possible they should be issued in one of the following district registries, in which a TCC judge will usually be available -\n\nBirmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Chester, Exeter, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Mold, Newcastle upon Tyne and Nottingham.\n\n3.4 The County Court hearing centres in which a TCC claim may be issued are the following -\n\nBirmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Central London, Chester, Exeter, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Mold, Newcastle upon Tyne and Nottingham.\n\n---\n\nApplications before proceedings are issued\n\n4.1 A party who intends to issue a TCC claim must make any application before the claim form is issued to a TCC judge.\n\n4.2 The written evidence in support of such an application must state that the proposed claim is a TCC claim.\n\n---\n\nTransfer of proceedings\n\n5.1 Where no TCC judge is available to deal with a claim which has been issued in a High Court District Registry or one of the County Court hearing centres listed in paragraph 3.4 above, the claim may be transferred -\n\n(1) if it has been issued in a District Registry, to another District Registry or to the High Court in London; or\n\n(2) if it has been issued in the County Court, to another County Court hearing centre where a TCC judge would be available.\n\n5.2 Paragraph 5.1 is without prejudice to the court's general powers to transfer proceedings under Part 30.\n\n(Rule 30.5(3) provides that an application for the transfer of proceedings to or from a specialist list must be made to a judge dealing with claims in that list.)\n\n5.3 A party applying to a TCC judge to transfer a claim to the TCC specialist list must give notice of the application to the court in which the claim is proceeding, and a TCC judge will not make an order for transfer until he is satisfied that such notice has been given.\n\n---\n\nAssignment of claim to a TCC judge\n\n6.1 When a TCC claim is issued or an order is made transferring a claim to the TCC specialist list, the court will assign the claim to a named TCC judge ('the assigned TCC judge') who will have the primary responsibility for the case management of that claim.\n\n6.2 All documents relating to the claim must be marked in similar manner to the claim form with the words 'Technology and Construction Court' and the name of the assigned TCC judge.\n\n---\n\nApplications\n\n7.1 An application should normally be made to the assigned TCC judge. If the assigned TCC judge is not available, or the court gives permission, the application may be made to another TCC judge.\n\n7.2 If an application is urgent and there is no TCC judge available to deal with it, the application may be made to any judge who, if the claim were not a TCC claim, would be authorised to deal with the application.\n\n---\n\nCase management conference\n\n8.1 The court will fix a case management conference within 14 days of the earliest of these events -\n\n(1) the filing of an acknowledgment of service;\n\n(2) the filing of a defence; or\n\n(3) the date of an order transferring the claim to a TCC.\n\n8.2 When the court notifies the parties of the date and time of the case management conference, it will at the same time send each party a case management information sheet and a case management directions form.\n\n(The case management information sheet and the case management directions form are in the form set out in Appendixes A and B to this practice direction.)\n\n8.3 Not less than two days before the case management conference, each party must file and serve on all other parties -\n\n(1) completed copies of the case management information sheet and case management directions form; and\n\n(2) an application notice for any order which that party intends to seek at the case management conference, other than directions referred to in the case management directions form.\n\n8.4 The parties are encouraged to agree directions to propose to the court by reference to the case management directions form.\n\n8.5 If any party fails to file or serve the case management information sheet and the case management directions form by the date specified, the court may -\n\n(1) impose such sanction as it sees fit; and\n\n(2) either proceed with or adjourn the case management conference.\n\n8.6 The directions given at the case management conference will normally include the fixing of dates for -\n\n(1) any further case management conferences;\n\n(2) a pre-trial review;\n\n(3) the trial of any preliminary issues that it orders to be tried; and\n\n(4) the trial.\n\n---\n\nPre-trial review\n\n9.1 When the court fixes the date for a pre-trial review it will send each party a pre-trial review questionnaire.\n\n(The pre-trial review questionnaire is in the form set out in Appendix C to this practice direction).\n\n9.2 Each party must file and serve on all other parties completed copies of the questionnaire not less than two days before the date fixed for the pre-trial review.\n\n9.3 The parties are encouraged to agree directions to propose to the court.\n\n9.4 If any party fails to return or exchange the questionnaire by the date specified the court may -\n\n(1) impose such sanction as it sees fit; and\n\n(2) either proceed with or adjourn the pre-trial review.\n\n9.5 At the pre-trial review, the court will give such directions for the conduct of the trial as it sees fit.\n\n---\n\nListing\n\n10 The provisions about listing questionnaires and listing in Part 29 and Practice Direction 29 do not apply to TCC claims.\n\n---\n\nTrial\n\n11.1 Whenever possible the trial of a claim will be heard by the assigned TCC judge.\n\n11.2 A TCC claim may be tried at any place where there is a TCC judge available to try the claim.\n\n---\n\nAppendix A\n\n---\n\nTechnology and Construction Court Claims\n\nTCC/CM 1 Case management information sheet (Appendix A)\n\nAvailable on Formfinder.\n\n---\n\nAppendix B\n\n---\n\nTechnology and Construction Court Claims\n\nTCC/CMD Case management directions form (Appendix B)\n\nAvailable on theforms page.\n\n---\n\nAppendix C\n\n---\n\nTechnology and Construction Court Claims\n\nTCC/PTR 1 Pre-trial review questionnaire (Appendix C)\n\nAvailable on Formfinder.",

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 61 - ADMIRALTY CLAIMS\n\n---\n\nThis Practice Direction Supplements CPR Part 61\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\n---\n\n61.1 - Scope\n\n1.1 Practice Direction 58 also applies to Admiralty claims except where it is inconsistent with Part 61 or this practice direction.\n\n1.2 Practice Direction 57 AC (Witness Evidence at Trial) applies to witness statements for use at trials in admiralty claims (including claims in rem, collision claims, and limitation claims) in the Admiralty Court, notwithstanding that such claims are not proceedings under CPR Part 7 or Part 8. It applies to proceedings in the Admiralty Court whenever begun, but only to trial witness statements signed on or after 1 October 2021.\n\n(Rule 61.1(2) defines an 'admiralty claim' as a claim within the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court as set out in section 20 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.)\"\n\n---\n\nCase management\n\n2.1 After a claim form is issued the Registrar will issue a direction in writing stating -\n\n(1) whether the claim will remain in the Admiralty Court or be transferred to another court; and\n\n(2) if the claim remains in the Admiralty Court -\n\n(a) whether it will be dealt with by -\n\n(i) the Admiralty Judge; or\n\n(ii) the Registrar; and\n\n(b) whether the trial will be in London or elsewhere.\n\n2.2 In making these directions the Registrar will have regard to -\n\n(1) the nature of the issues and the sums in dispute; and\n\n(2) the criteria set in rule 26.13 so far as they are applicable.\n\n2.3 Where the Registrar directs that the claim will be dealt with by the Admiralty Judge, case management directions will be given and any case management conference or pre-trial review will be heard by the Admiralty Judge.\n\n2.4 Where it is directed that a claim is to be dealt with by the Registrar, it is the Registrar who will give directions, conduct any case management conference and any pre-trial review, and try the claim.\n\n2.5 Appeals from all decisions and judgments of the Registrar are to the Admiralty Judge, unless otherwise ordered (and subject to article 4(1)(a) of the Access to Justice 1999 (Destination of Appeals) Order 2016, S.I. 2016 No. 917).\n\n2.6 A personal injury or fatal accident claim must be commenced in the Admiralty Court if it is made in rem or if it arises out of a collision; see CPR rules 61.2(1)(a)(i) and (ii).\n\n2.7 Personal injury and fatal accident claims falling within section 20(2)(f) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 made in personam, if commenced in the High Court, may be commenced in the Admiralty Court. Under its tort and contract jurisdiction and its jurisdiction to determine claims for sums recoverable under statute conferred by sections 15 and 16 of the County Courts Act 1984 respectively, such claims may also be commenced in the County Court.\n\n2.8 Claims within paragraph 2.7 should not be commenced in the Admiralty Court unless they require or would benefit from the specialist knowledge and experience of that court. That is likely to include personal injury claims-\n\n(a) which involve questions of navigation, seamanship, boat or ship-handling skills and/or acts or omissions relating to sea state;\n\n(b) which arise out of the shipwreck, capsizing or stranding of the ship, or explosion or fire in the ship;\n\n(c) which are employer's liability claims relating to or concerning equipment or working practices peculiar to a ship;\n\n(d) which raise difficult or novel questions of private international law or of the interpretation of the Athens Convention.\n\nOther personal injury claims not raising any such issues should ordinarily be commenced in the County Court or the Central Office of the King's Bench Division of the High Court.\n\n2.9 Where a personal injury or fatal accident claim in personam has been commenced in the Admiralty Court but, at any stage, it appears that it may be more efficiently or proportionately tried in another court, then it may be transferred to that other court on the application of any party or of the court's own motion (see CPR rule 61.2(3)). The County Court has similar powers under CPR rule 30.3, including the power to transfer to the Admiralty Court.\n\n---\n\n61.3 - Claims in rem\n\n3.1 A claim form in rem must be in Form ADM 1.\n\n3.2 The claimant in a claim in rem may be named or may be described, but if not named in the claim form must identify himself by name if requested to do so by any other party.\n\n3.3 The defendant must be described in the claim form.\n\n3.4 The acknowledgment of service must be in Form ADM 2. The person who acknowledges service must identify himself by name.\n\n3.5 The period for acknowledging service under rule 61.3(4) applies irrespective of whether the claim form contains particulars of claim.\n\n3.6 A claim form in rem may be served in the following ways:\n\n(1) on the property against which the claim is brought by fixing a copy of the claim form -\n\n(a) on the outside of the property in a position which may reasonably be expected to be seen; or\n\n(b) where the property is freight, either -\n\n(i) on the cargo in respect of which the freight was earned; or\n\n(ii) on the ship on which the cargo was carried;\n\n(2) if the property to be served is in the custody of a person who will not permit access to it, by leaving a copy of the claim form with that person;\n\n(3) where the property has been sold by the Marshal, by filing the claim form at the court;\n\n(4) where there is a notice against arrest, on the person named in the notice as being authorised to accept service;\n\n(5) on any solicitor authorised to accept service;\n\n(6) in accordance with any agreement providing for service of proceedings; or\n\n(7) in any other manner as the court may direct under rule 6.15 provided that the property against which the claim is brought or part of it is within the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n3.7 In claims where the property -\n\n(1) is to be arrested; or\n\n(2) is already under arrest in current proceedings,\n\nthe Marshal will serve the in rem claim form if the claimant requests the court to do so.\n\n3.8 In all other cases in rem claim forms must be served by the claimant.\n\n3.9 Where the defendants are described and not named on the claim form (for example as 'the Owners of the Ship X'), any acknowledgment of service in addition to stating that description must also state the full names of the persons acknowledging service and the nature of their ownership.\n\n3.10 After the acknowledgment of service has been filed, the claim will follow the procedure applicable to a claim proceeding in the Commercial list except that the claimant is allowed 75 days to serve the particulars of claim.\n\n3.11 A defendant who files an acknowledgment of service to an in rem claim does not lose any right he may have to dispute the jurisdiction of the court (see rule 10.1(3)(b) and Part 11).\n\n3.12 Any person who pays the prescribed fee may, during office hours, search for, inspect and take a copy of any claim form in rem whether or not it has been served.\n\n---\n\n61.3 A - Claims in personam\n\n3 A.1 This section applies to Admiralty claims in personam (defined in rule 61.1(2)(bc) as an admiralty claim other than a claim in rem). Subject to the provisions of Part 61 and this practice direction relating to limitation claims and to collision claims, the following provisions apply to such claims.\n\n3 A.2 All such claims will proceed in accordance with Part 58 (Commercial Court).\n\n3 A.3 The claim form must be in Form ADM 1 A and must be served by the claimant.\n\n3 A.4 The claimant may be named or may be described, but if not named in the claim form must identify themselves by name if requested to do so by any other party.\n\n3 A.5 The defendant must be named in the claim form.\n\n3 A.6 Any person who files a defence must identify themselves by name in the defence.\n\n---\n\n61.4 - Collision claims\n\n4.1 A collision statement of case must be in form ADM 3.\n\n4.2 A collision statement of case must contain -\n\n(1) in Part 1 of the form, answers to the questions set out in that Part; and\n\n(2) in Part 2 of the form-\n\n(a)full particulars of-\n\n(i) the sequence of material events leading up to the collision;\n\n(ii) all allegations of causative negligence or other fault which the party filing the collision statement of case makes, and\n\n(iii) any other material facts and matters on which that party relies; and\n\n(b)a statement of the relief or remedy which the party filing the collision statement of case claims.\n\n4.3 When he files his collision statement of case each party must give notice to every other party that he has done so.\n\n4.4 Within 14 days after the last collision statement of case is filed each party must serve a copy of his collision statement of case on every other party.\n\n4.5 Before the coming into force of Part 61, a collision statement of case was known as a Preliminary Act and the law relating to Preliminary Acts will continue to apply to collision statements of case.\n\n4.5 A\n\n(1)In any collision defence, a party must state -\n\n(a) which of the allegations in Part 2 of the collision statement of case the party denies;\n\n(b)which such allegations the party is unable to admit or deny, but requires the other party to prove; and\n\n(c) which such allegations the party admits.\n\n(2)Where a party denies an allegation in Part 2 of the other party's collision statement of case-\n\n(a) the collision defence must state the reasons for doing so; and\n\n(b)if a different version of events from that given by the other party is to be put forward, the collision defence must state that version (which, where appropriate, may be done by reference to the party's own collision statement of case).\n\n(3)A party who-\n\n(a)fails to deal with an allegation in Part 2 of another party's collision statement of case; but\n\n(b)has set out in a collision defence a case in relation to the issue to which that allegation is relevant,shall be taken to require that allegation to be proved.\n\n(4)Subject to paragraph (3), a party who fails to deal with an allegation in Part 2 of another party's collision statement of case shall be taken to admit that allegation.\n\n4.5 BWhen a collision defence is filed, the party filing must give notice of that filing to every other party.\n\n4.5 CWithin 14 days after the last collision defence is filed each party must serve a copy of their collision defence on every other party.\n\n4.5 DIf a collision reply is filed, the party filing must-\n\n(a)give notice of that filing to every other party;

and/or\n\n(i) making a costs capping order.\n\n(2) The parties should give careful consideration to adopting these and/or other procedures and directions when completing their case management information sheets. The court will give due consideration to any agreement made by the parties which is intended to dispose of the claim in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.\n\n---\n\nShorter and flexible trials of collision cases\n\n4.8 In a collision action to which rule 61.4(4 A) and paragraph 4.7 of this practice direction do not apply, the parties will be expected to consider whether the claim is suitable to tried in accordance with Practice Direction 57 AB (Shorter and Flexible Trial Schemes).\n\n4.9 Practice Direction 57 AB applies to collision claims with the following modifications-\n\n(1) paragraphs 2.09 to 2.34 do not apply and paragraphs 4.1 to 4.6 of this practice direction will apply instead;

or\n\n(2) if he does not grant a decree -\n\n(a) order service of a defence; and\n\n(c) make such other case management directions as may be appropriate.\n\n10.9 The fact that a limitation fund has lapsed under rule 61.11(20)(a) does not prevent the establishment of a new fund.\n\n10.9 AA limitation fund may be constituted by-\n\n(1) making a payment into court;\n\n(2) providing court-approved security; or\n\n(3) a combination of (1) and (2).\n\n10.10 Where a limitation fund is established by making a payment into court, the sum paid in must be -\n\n(1) the sterling equivalent of the number of special drawing rights to which [the claimant] claims to be entitled to limit his liability under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995;

If the security is expressed in sterling, the amount of the security shall be the same as if the fund were being constituted by payment in to court and paragraphs 10.10 and 10.11(1) above shall apply in an equivalent sense.\n\n10.13 EThe claimant must give notice in writing to every named defendant and any interested party whose address is known of any court-approved security lodged at court, specifying-\n\n(1) the terms of the security;\n\n(2) the date on which the security was lodged at court;\n\n(3) how the amount of security was calculated;\n\n(4) the amount and rate of interest included, and the period to which it relates,\n\nand shall provide on request any person so notified with a copy of the security so lodged and the application made under paragraph 10.13 A.\n\n10.13 FAn application to set aside the court's approval of a security may be made by-\n\n(1) any person (whether a defendant, an interested party or another), who was not given notice of the claimant's application under paragraph 10.13 A; or\n\n(2) any person (whether a defendant, an interested party or another) if circumstances relevant to the adequacy of the security have changed since it was approved by the court.\n\n10.13 GAn application under paragraph 10.13 F(1) must be -\n\n(1) made on notice to the provider of the security, all claimants, all named defendants, and all interested parties (whose addresses are known);\n\n(2) supported by evidence setting out the reasons why the court's approval of the security should be set aside; and\n\n(3) made within 21 days of receipt by the applicant of notice given under paragraph 10.13 E (if such notice was given to the applicant) or as soon as reasonably practicable (if no such notice was given to the applicant).\n\n10.13 HAn application under paragraph 10.13 F(2) must be-\n\n(1) made on notice to the provider of the security, all claimants, all named defendants, and all Interested Parties (whose addresses are known);\n\n(2) supported by evidence setting out the change in circumstances justifying the setting aside of the court's approval of the security; and\n\n(3) made as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the change of circumstances.\n\n10.13 IOn an application under paragraph 10.13 F, the court may-\n\n(1) confirm its approval of the adequacy of the security;\n\n(2) set aside its approval of the adequacy of the security; and/or\n\n(3) require the fund to be reconstituted in such manner and on such terms as it thinks fit.\n\n10.13 JIf a claimant has constituted a fund by payment in of money, it may apply at any time for an order permitting the reconstitution of the fund (in whole or in part) by means of a court-approved security. Any such application shall be made in accordance with paragraphs 10.13 A to 10.13 E, and paragraphs 10.13 F to 10.13 I shall apply to any order made.\".\n\n10.14 A claim against the fund must be in form ADM 20.\n\n10.15 A defendant's statement of case filed and served in accordance with rule 61.11(15) must contain particulars of the defendant's claim.\n\n10.16 Any defendant who is unable to file and serve a statement of case in accordance with rule 61.11(15) and paragraph 10.15 must file a declaration, verified by a statement of truth, in form ADM 21 stating the reason for his inability.\n\n10.17 No later than 7 days after the time for filing claims [or declarations], the Registrar will fix a date for a case management conference at which directions will be given for the further conduct of the proceedings.\n\n10.18 Nothing in rule 61.11 prevents limitation being relied on by way of defence.\n\n---\n\nProceeding against or concerning the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund 1992 and the International Oil Pollution Supplementary Fund\n\n11.1 For the purposes of section 177 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 ('the Act'), the Fund may be given notice of proceedings by any party to a claim against an owner or guarantor in respect of liability under section 153 of the Act by that person serving a notice in writing on the Fund together with copies of the claim form and any statements of case served in the claim.\n\n11.2 Notice given to the Fund under paragraph 11.1 shall be deemed to have been given to the Supplementary Fund.\n\n11.3 The Fund or the Supplementary Fund may intervene in any claim to which paragraph 11.1 applies, (whether or not served with the notice), by serving notice of intervention on the -\n\n(1) owner;\n\n(2) guarantor; and\n\n(3) court.\n\n11.4 Where a judgment is given against -\n\n(1) the Fund in any claim under section 175 of the Act;\n\n(2) the Supplementary Fund in any claim under section 176 A of the Act, the Registrar will arrange for a stamped copy of the judgment to be sent by post to -\n\n(a) the Fund (where paragraph (1) applies);\n\n(b) the Supplementary Fund (where paragraph (2) applies).\n\n11.5 Notice to the Registrar of the matters set out in -\n\n(1) section 176(3)(b) of the Act in proceedings under section 175; or\n\n(2) section 176 B(2)(b) of the Act in proceedings under section 176 A, must be given in writing and sent to the court by -\n\n(a) the Fund (where paragraph (1) applies);\n\n(b) the Supplementary Fund (where paragraph (2) applies).\n\n---\n\nReferences to the Registrar\n\n13.1 The court may at any stage in the claim refer any question or issue for determination by the Registrar (a 'reference').\n\n13.2 Unless the court orders otherwise, where a reference has been ordered -\n\n(1) if particulars of claim have not already been served, the claimant must file and serve particulars of claim on all other parties within 14 days after the date of the order;\n\n(2) any party opposing the claim must file a defence to the claim within 14 days after service of the particulars of claim on him;\n\n(3) the rules concerning statements of case shall apply to the particulars of claim, the defence and any other statements of case served in the reference; and\n\n(4) all documents which the claimant (or counterclaimant) in a reference intends to rely on in order to show that the sums claimed were properly incurred and paid ('vouchers') shall be appended to their first statement of case in the reference and cross referenced to the sums being claimed, unless there is a compelling reason not to do so.\n\n13.3 Within 7 days after the defence is filed, the claimant must apply for an appointment before the Registrar for a case management conference.\n\n---\n\nUndertakings\n\n14.1 Where, in [Part 61] or this practice direction, any undertaking to the Marshal is required it must be given -\n\n(1) in writing and to his satisfaction; or\n\n(2) in accordance with such other arrangements as he may require.\n\n14.2 Where any party is dissatisfied with a direction given by the Marshal in this respect he may apply to the Registrar for a ruling.\n\n---\n\nAdmiralty Claims\n\nADM 1 to ADM 22\n\nAvailable on theforms page.",

and(b) unless the court otherwise orders, any application relating to the enforcement of a Financial List judgment or order for the payment of money will be dealt with by the allocated judge unless that judge directs it to be dealt with by a Master of the King's Bench Division or of the Chancery Division or a District Judge.1.3 Provisions in other practice directions which refer to a Master or District Judge are to be read, in relation to claims in the Financial List, as if they referred to a Financial List judge.1.4 The Admiralty and Commercial Registry in the Royal Courts of Justice is the administrative office of the court for all proceedings in the Financial List commenced in the Commercial Court and the Chancery Registry in the Royal Courts of Justice is the administrative office of the court for all proceedings in the Financial List commenced in the Chancery Division.\n\n---\n\nStarting proceedings in the Financial List\n\n2.1 Claims in the Financial List must be issued in either the Chancery Registry or the Admiralty and Commercial Registry.2.2 A claim form issued in the Admiralty and Commercial Registry must be marked in the top right hand corner \"King's Bench Division, Commercial Court, Financial List\" and a claim form issued in the Chancery Division must be marked in the top right hand corner \"Chancery Division, Financial List\".2.3 A claimant starting proceedings in the Financial List, other than an arbitration claim, must use practice form N 1(CCFL) for Part 7 claims issued in the Commercial Court, practice form N 1(CHFL) for Part 7 claims issued in the Chancery Division, practice form N 208(CCFL) for Part 8 claims issued in the Commercial Court or practice form N 208(CHFL) for Part 8 claims issued in the Chancery Division.\n\n---\n\nApplications before proceedings are issued\n\n3.1 A party who intends to bring a claim in the Financial List must make any application before the claim form is issued to a Financial List judge.3.2 The written evidence in support of such an application must state that the claimant intends to bring proceedings in the Financial List.3.3 If the Financial List judge hearing the application considers that the proceedings should not be brought in the Financial List, that judge may adjourn the application to be heard by a Master or by a judge who is not a Financial List judge.\n\n---\n\nTransferring proceedings to or from the Financial List\n\n4.1 Rule 30.5 applies to the Financial List as a specialist list and applications for the transfer of proceedings to or from the Financial List must be made to a Financial List judge.4.2 If an application is made to a judge other than a Financial List judge to transfer proceedings to the Financial List, the other judge may -(a) adjourn the application to be heard by a Financial List judge; or(b) dismiss the application.4.3 If a Financial List judge orders proceedings to be transferred to the Financial List, that judge -(a) will order them to be transferred to the Royal Courts of Justice; and(b) may give case management directions.4.4 A party applying to a Financial List judge to transfer a claim to the Financial List must give notice of the application to the court in which the claim is proceeding, and the Financial List judge will not make an order for transfer until satisfied that such notice has been given.4.5 An application by a defendant, including a Part 20 defendant, for an order transferring proceedings from the Financial List should be made promptly and normally not later than the first case management conference.4.6 In considering whether to transfer a claim to or from the Financial List and in addition to the criteria set out in rule 30.3 the court may have regard to the Guide to the Financial List.\n\n---\n\nProceedings in the Financial List\n\n5.1 Paragraphs 5 to 14 of Practice Direction 58 shall apply to claims in the Financial List in the same manner as they apply to claims in the Commercial Court.5.2 Appendix A of Practice Direction 58 shall apply to claims in the Financial List, the \"Registry\" being the Admiralty and Commercial Registry for claims commenced in the Commercial Court and the Chancery Registry for claims commenced in the Chancery Division.\n\n---\n\nFinancial Markets Test Case Scheme\n\n6.1 The Financial Markets Test Case Scheme applies to a claim started in the Financial List which is a Financial List claim and which raises issues of general importance in relation to which immediately relevant authoritative English law guidance is needed (\"a qualifying claim\").\n\n6.2 In such cases the Financial Markets Test Case Scheme enables the qualifying claim to be determined without the need for a present cause of action between the parties to the proceedings.\n\nProceedings in the Financial Markets Test Case Scheme\n\n6.3 Where there is a qualifying claim a person who is or was actively in business in the relevant market may, by mutual agreement, issue proceedings against another person who is or was actively in business in the relevant market provided that other person has opposing interests as to how the law of England and Wales issue(s) raised by the qualifying claim should be resolved.\n\n6.4 The claim form must indicate clearly that the claim is brought pursuant to the Financial List, Financial Markets Test Case Scheme.\n\n6.5 Proceedings will be conducted in accordance with the procedure applicable to claims in the Financial List save that-\n\n(a) for proceedings to be allowed to proceed to trial or summary determination the judge hearing the first case management conference or summary application must be satisfied that it is a qualifying claim, that it is a claim which can be satisfactorily determined as a test case and that the arguments of all those with opposing interests in relation to the issues in question will be properly put before the court by those represented. For these purposes, in appropriate cases a relevant trade, professional or regulatory body or association, or a third party affected by the determination of the issues, may, with the permission of the court, be joined as a party or otherwise allowed to be represented;\n\n(b) the parties will seek to agree the facts;\n\n(c) the general rule will be that there shall be no order as to costs;\n\n(d) in a case of particular importance or urgency the trial may, at the court's discretion, be heard by a court consisting of two Financial List judges, or a Financial List judge and a Lord or Lady Justice of Appeal.",

or\n\n(iii) a beneficial interest in any property subject to a trust;\n\n(b) any question as to the rights or interests of any person claiming -\n\n(i) to be a creditor of the estate of a deceased person;\n\n(ii) to be entitled under a will or on the intestacy of a deceased person; or\n\n(iii) to be beneficially entitled under a trust;\n\n(2) a claim for any of the following remedies -\n\n(a) an order requiring a trustee -\n\n(i) to provide and, if necessary, verify accounts;\n\n(ii) to pay into court money which he holds in that capacity; or\n\n(iii) to do or not to do any particular act;\n\n(b) an order approving any sale, purchase, compromise or other transaction by a trustee (whether administrative or dispositive); or\n\n(c) an order directing any act to be done which the court could order to be done if the estate or trust in question were being administered or executed under the direction of the court.\n\n---\n\nDetermining certain claims under rule 64.2(a) without a hearing\n\n1 A.1 Where a claim is made by a trustee for a remedy within paragraph 1(2)(b) (including a case where the remedy sought is approval of a transaction affected by conflict of interests or duties), the court may be requested to determine the claim without a hearing.\n\n1 A.2 The claim form in such a case may be issued in accordance with rule 8.2 A (Issue of claim form without naming defendants), and no separate application for permission under rule 8.2 A need be made.\n\n1 A.3 The claim form must be accompanied by -\n\n(a) a witness statement setting out the material facts justifying determination without a hearing and in particular -\n\n(i) identifying those affected by the remedy sought and\n\n(ii) detailing any consultation of those so affected and the result of that consultation;\n\n(b) the advice of a lawyer having a 10-year High Court qualification within the meaning of section 71 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 on the merits of the claim;\n\n(c) a draft order for the remedy sought;\n\n(d) a statement of costs.\n\n1 A.4 If the court considers that the case does not require an oral hearing, it will proceed to consider the claim on the papers.\n\n1 A.5 If the court considers that an oral hearing is required, it will give appropriate directions.\n\n1 A.6 If the court considers it appropriate, it will make the order sought and may direct that the claimant must -\n\n(a) serve notice of the order on the interested parties in accordance with rule 19.8 A, and\n\n(b) file a certificate of service within 7 days of doing so.\n\n---\n\nApplications by trustees for directions\n\n2 A separate practice direction contains guidance about applications by trustees for directions.\n\n---\n\nAdministration orders - rule 64.2(b)\n\n3.1 The court will only make an administration order if it considers that the issues between the parties cannot properly be resolved in any other way.\n\n3.2 If, in a claim for an administration order, the claimant alleges that the trustees have not provided proper accounts, the court may -\n\n(1) stay the proceedings for a specified period, and order them to file and serve proper accounts within that period; or\n\n(2) if necessary to prevent proceedings by other creditors or persons claiming to be entitled to the estate or fund, make an administration order and include in it an order that no such proceedings are to be taken without the court's permission.\n\n3.3 Where an administration order has been made in relation to the estate of a deceased person, and a claim is made against the estate by any person who is not a party to the proceedings -\n\n(1) no party other than the executors or administrators of the estate may take part in any proceedings relating to the claim without the permission of the court; and\n\n(2) the court may direct or permit any other party to take part in the proceedings, on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit.\n\n3.4 Where an order is made for the sale of any property vested in trustees, those persons shall have the conduct of the sale unless the court directs otherwise.\n\n---\n\nApplications under the Variation of Trusts Act 1958 - rule 64.2(c)\n\n4.1 Where children or unborn beneficiaries will be affected by a proposed arrangement under the Act, the evidence filed in support of the application must -\n\n(1) show that their litigation friends or the trustees support the arrangements as being in the interests of the children or unborn beneficiaries; and\n\n(2) unless paragraph 4.3 applies or the court orders otherwise, be accompanied by a written opinion to this effect by the advocate who will appear on the hearing of the application.\n\n4.2 A written opinion filed under paragraph 4.1(2) must -\n\n(1) if it is given on formal instructions, be accompanied by a copy of those instructions; or\n\n(2) otherwise, state fully the basis on which it is given.\n\n4.3 No written opinion needs to be filed in support of an application to approve an arrangement under section 1(1)(d) of the Act (discretionary interests under protective trusts).\n\n4.4 Where the interests of two or more children, or two or more of the children and unborn beneficiaries, are similar, only a single written opinion needs to be filed.\n\n---\n\nApplications under section 48 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985 - rule 64.2(d)\n\n5 A Part 8 claim form for an application by trustees under section 48 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985 (power of High Court to authorise action to be taken in reliance on legal opinion) may be issued without naming a defendant, under rule 8.2 A. No separate application for permission under rule 8.2 A need be made.\n\n---\n\nProspective costs orders\n\n6.1 These paragraphs are about the costs of applications under rule 64.2(a).\n\n6.2 Where trustees have power to agree to pay the costs of a party to such an application, and exercise such a power, rule 44.5 applies. In such a case, an order is not required and the trustees are entitled to recover out of the trust fund any costs which they pay pursuant to the agreement made in the exercise of such power.\n\n6.3 Where the trustees do not have, or decide not to exercise, a power to make such an agreement, the trustees or the party concerned may apply to the court at any stage of proceedings for an order that the costs of any party (including the costs of the trustees) shall be paid out of the fund (a 'prospective costs order').\n\n6.4 The court, on an application for a prospective costs order, may -\n\n(a) in the case of the trustees' costs, authorise the trustees to raise and meet such costs out of the fund;\n\n(b) in the case of the costs of any other party, authorise or direct the trustees to pay such costs (or any part of them, or the costs incurred up to a particular time) out of the trust fund to be assessed, if not agreed by the trustees, on the indemnity basis or, if the court directs, on the standard basis, and to make payments from time to time on account of such costs. A model form of order is annexed to this Practice Direction.\n\n6.5 The court will always consider whether it is possible to deal with the application for a prospective costs order on paper without a hearing and in an ordinary case would expect to be able to do so. The trustees must consider whether a hearing is needed for any reason. If they consider that it is they should say so and explain why in their evidence. If any party to the application referred to in paragraph 6.1 above (or any other person interested in the trust fund) considers that a hearing is necessary (for instance because he wishes to oppose the making of a prospective costs order) this should be stated, and the reasons explained, in his evidence, if any, or otherwise in a letter to the court.\n\n6.6 If the court would be minded to refuse the application on a consideration of the papers alone, the parties will be notified and given the opportunity, within a stated time, to ask for a hearing.\n\n6.7 The evidence in support of an application for a prospective costs order should be given by witness statement. The trustees and the applicant (if different) must ensure full disclosure of the relevant matters to show that the case is one which falls within the category of case where a prospective costs order can properly be made.\n\n6.8 The model form of order is designed for use in the more straightforward cases, where a question needs to be determined which has arisen in the administration of the trust, whether the claimants are the trustees or a beneficiary.

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION 64 B - APPLICATIONS TO THE COURT FOR DIRECTIONS BY TRUSTEES IN RELATION TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST\n\nThis Practice Direction supplements Section I of Part 64\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\nThis Practice Direction is about applications to the court for directions by trustees in relation to the administration of the trust.\n\n---\n\nContents of the claim form\n\nIf confidentiality of the directions sought is important (for example, where the directions relate to actual or proposed litigation with a third party who could find out what directions the trustees are seeking through access to the claim form under CPR rule 5.4) the statement of the remedy sought, for the purposes of CPR rule 8.2(b), may be expressed in general terms. The trustees must, in that case, state specifically in the evidence what it is that they seek to be allowed to do.\n\n---\n\nProceedings in private\n\nThe proceedings will in the first instance be listed in private (see paragraph 1.5 of Practice Direction 39 A and rule 39.2(3)(f)). Accordingly the order made, as well as the other documents among the court records (apart from a claim form which has been served), will not be open to inspection by third parties without the court's permission (rule 5.4(2)). If the matter is disposed of without a hearing, the order made will be expressed to have been made in private.\n\n---\n\nJoining defendants or giving notice to those interested\n\n---\n\n4.1\n\nRule 64.4(1)(c) deals with the joining of beneficiaries as defendants. Often, especially in the case of a private trust, it will be clear that some, and which, beneficiaries need to be joined as defendants. Sometimes, if there are only two views of the appropriate course, and one is advocated by one beneficiary who will be joined, it may not be necessary for other beneficiaries to be joined since the trustees may be able to present the other arguments. Equally, in the case of pension trust, it may not be necessary for a member of every possible different class of beneficiaries to be joined.\n\n---\n\n4.2\n\nIn some cases the court may be able to assess whether or not to give the directions sought, or what directions to give, without hearing from any party other than the trustees. If the trustees consider that their case is in that category they may apply to the court to issue the claim form without naming any defendants under rule 8.2 A. They must apply to the court before the claim form is issued (rule 8.2 A(2)) and include a copy of the claim form that they propose to issue (rule 8.2 A(3)(b)).\n\n---\n\n4.3\n\nIn other cases the trustees may know that beneficiaries need to be joined as defendants, or to be given notice, but may be in doubt as to which. Examples could include a case concerning a pension scheme with many beneficiaries and a number of different categories of interest, especially if they may be differently affected by the action for which directions are sought, or a private trust with a large class of discretionary beneficiaries. In those cases the trustees may apply to issue the claim form without naming any defendants under rule 8.2 A. The application may be combined with an application to the court for directions as to which persons to join as parties or to give notice to under rule 19.8 A.\n\n---\n\n4.4\n\nIn the case of a charitable trust the Attorney-General is always the appropriate defendant, and almost always the only one.\n\nCase management directions\n\n---\n\n5.1\n\nThe claim will be referred to the master or district judge once a defendant has acknowledged service, or otherwise on expiry of the period for acknowledgment of service, (or, if no defendant is named, as soon as the claimants' evidence has been filed) to consider directions for the management of the case. Such directions may be given without a hearing in some cases; these might include directions as to parties or as to notice of proceedings, as mentioned in paragraph 4 above.\n\n---\n\nProceeding without a hearing\n\n---\n\n6.1\n\n(1) The court will dispose of the application without a hearing if it considers that to do so will save time or expense, and that a hearing is not necessary. The trustees must therefore consider whether a hearing is necessary and, if so, explain why in their evidence.\n\n(2) When considering whether to hold a hearing, the court will take into account any dispute between the parties as to directions, but will not necessarily direct a hearing for that reason alone.\n\n(3) If a defendant considers that a hearing is needed, and that the need is not sufficiently explained in the trustees' evidence, that defendant should so state in evidence, giving reasons why.\n\n---\n\n6.2\n\nWhere the court deals with an application without a hearing, it will in any order give the parties an opportunity, within a stated time, to apply to vary or discharge the order at an oral hearing.\n\n6.3\n\nIn charity cases, the master or district judge may deal with the case without a hearing on the basis of a letter by or on behalf of the Attorney-General that sets out his attitude to the application.\n\nEvidence\n\n---\n\n7.1\n\nThe trustees' evidence should be given by witness statement. In order to ensure that, if directions are given, the trustees are properly protected by the order, they must ensure full disclosure of relevant matters, even if the case is to proceed with the participation of beneficiaries as defendants.\n\n---\n\n7.2\n\nApplications for directions whether or not to take or defend or pursue litigation should be supported by evidence of the following matters -\n\n(1) the advice of an appropriately qualified lawyer as to the prospects of success;\n\n(2) an estimate in summary form of -\n\n(a) the value or other significance to the trust estate of the issues in the proceedings;\n\n(b) the costs likely to be incurred by the trustees in the proceedings, by reference to the principal stages in the proceedings; and\n\n(c) the costs of other parties to the proceedings for which, if unsuccessful, the trustees may be exposed to liability;\n\n(3) any known facts concerning the means of other parties to the proceedings; and\n\n(4) any other factors relevant to the court's decision whether to give the directions sought.\n\n---\n\n7.3\n\nReferences in this practice direction to an appropriately qualified lawyer mean one whose qualifications and experience are appropriate to the circumstances of the case. The qualifications should be stated. If the advice is given on formal instructions, the instructions should always be put in evidence as well, so that the court can see the basis on which the advice was given. If it is not, the advice must state fully the basis on which it is given.\n\n---\n\n7.4\n\nAll applications for directions should be supported by evidence showing the value of the trust assets, the significance of the proposed litigation or other course of action for the trust, and why the court's directions are needed.In the case of a pension trust the evidence should include the latest actuarial valuation, and should describe the membership profile and, if a deficit on winding up is likely, the priority provisions and their likely effect.\n\n---\n\n7.5\n\nOn an application for directions about actual or possible litigation the evidence should also state whether (i) the Practice Direction (Pre-Action Conduct) or any relevant Pre-Action Protocol has been complied with; and (ii) the trustees have proposed or undertaken, or intend to propose, mediation by ADR, and (in each case) if not why not.\n\n---\n\n7.6\n\nIf a beneficiary of the trust is a party to the litigation about which directions are sought, with an interest opposed to that of the trustees, that beneficiary should be a defendant to the trustees' application, but any material which would be privileged as regards that beneficiary in the litigation should be put in evidence as exhibits to the trustees' witness statement, and should not be served on the beneficiary. However if the trustees' representatives consider that no harm would be done by the disclosure of all or some part of the material, then that material should be served on that defendant. That defendant may also be excluded from part of the hearing, including that which is devoted to discussion of the material withheld.\n\n---\n\nConsultation with beneficiaries\n\n---\n\n7.7\n\nThe evidence must explain what, if any, consultation there has been with beneficiaries, and with what result. In preparation for an application for directions in respect of litigation, the following guidance is to be followed:\n\n(1) If the trust is a private trust where the beneficiaries principally concerned are not numerous and are all or mainly adult, identified and traceable, the trustees will be expected to have canvassed with all the adult beneficiaries the proposed or possible courses of action before applying for directions.\n\n(2) If it is a private trust with a larger number of beneficiaries, including those not yet born or identified, or children, it is likely that there will nevertheless be some adult beneficiaries principally concerned, with whom the trustees must consult.\n\n(3) In relation to a charitable trust the trustees must have consulted the Attorney-General, through the Treasury Solicitor, as well as the Charity Commissioners whose consent to the application will have been needed under section 33 of the Charities Act 1993.\n\n(4) In relation to a pension trust, unless the members are very few in number, no particular steps by way of consultation with beneficiaries (including, where relevant, employers) or their representatives are required in preparation for the application, though the trustees' evidence should describe any consultation that has in fact taken place.\n\n---\n\n7.8\n\n(1) If the court gives directions allowing the trustees to take, defend or pursue litigation it may do so up to a particular stage in the litigation, requiring the trustees, before they carry on beyond that point, to renew their application to the court. What stage that should be will depend on the likely management of the litigation under the CPR. If the application is to be renewed after disclosure of documents, and disclosed documents need to be shown to the court, it may be necessary to obtain permission to do this from the court in which the other litigation is proceeding.\n\n(2) In such a case the court will if possible deal with the matter without a hearing, and in deciding whether to do so will take into account the advice of an appropriately qualified lawyer supporting the continuation by the trustees of the pursuit or defence (as the case may be) of the proceedings.\n\n---\n\n7.9\n\nIn a case of urgency, such as where a limitation period or period for service of proceedings is about to expire, the court may be able to give directions on a summary consideration of the evidence to cover the steps which need to be taken urgently, but limiting those directions so that the application needs to be renewed on fuller consideration at an early stage.\n\n---\n\n7.10\n\nIn any application for directions where a child is a defendant, the court will expect to have put before it the instructions to and advice of an appropriately qualified lawyer as to the benefits and disadvantages of the proposed, and any other relevant, course of action from the point of view of the child beneficiary.\n\n---\n\n7.11\n\nA Master may give the directions sought, whether at a hearing or on paper pursuant to paragraph 6. They will ordinarily do so, but may refer the matter to a High Court Judge if they consider it appropriate. District Judges may give the directions sought only with the consent of their Supervising Judge or their nominee (see PD 2 B para. 7 B.2(c)).\n\n---\n\n7.12\n\nWhere a hearing takes place, if the advice of a lawyer has been put in evidence in accordance with paragraph 7.2 or 7.10, that lawyer should if possible appear on the hearing.",

When considering questions of venue under rule 30.3(2), the court should have regard to the Attorney General's note in addition to all the other circumstances of the case.\n\nThis note sets out the further factors to be taken into consideration where there is a dispute as to venue between a claimant and a government department. Where there is such a dispute, it should be dealt with at a case management conference.\n\n---\n\nOrganisation of the Government Legal Service\n\nLawyers in the Government Legal Service (GLS) provide legal advice to the government and represent it in court proceedings. The Government Legal Department, headed by the Treasury Solicitor, conducts this litigation for the majority of government departments, but lawyers in HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have the conduct of litigation for their department. Most government litigation lawyers are based in London. HMRC also has litigation lawyers based in Manchester who deal with judicial reviews and tax litigation. A full list of addresses for service is annexed to Practice Direction 66.\n\n---\n\nFactors be taken into account generally\n\n---\n\nLocation\n\nWhile a number of government departments have offices outside London, central government bodies are based in London and the GLS is geared towards processing claims in the Royal Courts of Justice (see above). Where there is a High Court claim, many witnesses as well as lawyers and officials are London-based and there may be a disproportionate cost in transferring them to a venue outside London. That is not to say, bearing in mind the overriding objective, that the Crown would oppose transfer away from the Royal Courts of Justice where it was appropriate, for example in personal injury disputes.\n\n---\n\nPrecedent value\n\nSome cases have important precedent value or are of general importance to the public, which may make them more suitable for being heard in the Royal Courts of Justice.\n\n---\n\nSpecial Considerations in relation to HM Revenue and Customs\n\nHMRC has litigation lawyers based in London and Manchester. The lawyers based in London deal with all types of HMRC's litigation. The lawyers based in Manchester deal with judicial reviews and tax litigation in cases where it makes sense to conduct the litigation outside of London, typically where the claimant's or appellant's address is in, or north of, Birmingham.\n\nRT HON JEREMY WRIGHT QC MPATTORNEY GENERAL",

Among other things, it provides that a Master or a District Judge may grant an injunction related to an order appointing a receiver by way of equitable execution.\n\n---\n\nEvidence in support of an application - rule 69.3\n\n4.1 The written evidence in support of an application for the appointment of a receiver must -\n\n(1) explain the reasons why the appointment is required;\n\n(2) give details of the property which it is proposed that the receiver should get in or manage, including estimates of -\n\n(a) the value of the property; and\n\n(b) the amount of income it is likely to produce;\n\n(3) if the application is to appoint a receiver by way of equitable execution, give details of -\n\n(a) the judgment which the applicant is seeking to enforce;\n\n(b) the extent to which the debtor has failed to comply with the judgment;\n\n(c) the result of any steps already taken to enforce the judgment; and\n\n(d) why the judgment cannot be enforced by any other method; and\n\n(4) if the applicant is asking the court to allow the receiver to act -\n\n(a) without giving security; or\n\n(b) before he has given security or satisfied the court that he has security in place,\n\nexplain the reasons why that is necessary.\n\n4.2 In addition, the written evidence should normally identify an individual whom the court is to be asked to appoint as receiver ('the nominee'), and should -\n\n(1) state the name, address and position of the nominee;\n\n(2) include written evidence by a person who knows the nominee, stating that he believes the nominee is a suitable person to be appointed as receiver, and the basis of that belief; and\n\n(3) be accompanied by written consent, signed by the nominee, to act as receiver if appointed.\n\n4.3 If the applicant does not nominate a person to be appointed as receiver, or if the court decides not to appoint the nominee, the court may -\n\n(1) order that a suitable person be appointed as receiver; and\n\n(2) direct any party to nominate a suitable individual to be appointed.\n\n4.4 A party directed to nominate a person to be appointed as receiver must file written evidence containing the information required by paragraph 4.2 and accompanied by the written consent of the nominee.\n\n---\n\nAppointment of receiver to enforce a judgment\n\n5.Where a judgment creditor applies for the appointment of a receiver as a method of enforcing a judgment, in considering whether to make the appointment the court will have regard to -\n\n(1) the amount claimed by the judgment creditor;\n\n(2) the amount likely to be obtained by the receiver; and\n\n(3) the probable costs of his appointment.\n\n---\n\nCourt's directions\n\n6.1 The court may give directions to the receiver when it appoints him or at any time afterwards.\n\n6.2 The court will normally, when it appoints a receiver, give directions in relation to security - see paragraph 7 below.\n\n6.3 Other matters about which the court may give directions include -\n\n(1) whether, and on what basis, the receiver is to be remunerated for carrying out his functions;\n\n(2) the preparation and service of accounts - see rule 69.8(1) and paragraph 10 below;\n\n(3) the payment of money into court; and\n\n(4) authorising the receiver to carry on an activity or incur an expense.\n\n---\n\nDirections relating to security - rule 69.5\n\n7.1 An order appointing a receiver will normally specify the date by which the receiver must -\n\n(1) give security; or\n\n(2) file and serve evidence to satisfy the court that he already has security in force.\n\n7.2 Unless the court directs otherwise, security will be given -\n\n(1) if the receiver is an authorised insolvency practitioner, by the bond provided by him under the Insolvency Practitioner Regulations 1990 or the Insolvency Practitioners Regulations 2005 extended to cover appointment as a court appointed receiver; or\n\n(2) in any other case, by a guarantee.\n\n7.3 Where the court has given directions about giving security, then either -\n\n(1) written evidence of the bond, the sufficiency of its cover and that it includes appointment as a court appointed receiver must be filed at court; or\n\n(2) a guarantee should be prepared in a form, and entered into with a clearing bank or insurance company, approved by the court.\n\n---\n\nReceiver's application for directions - rule 69.6\n\n8.1 An application by a receiver for directions may be made by filing an application notice in accordance with Part 23.\n\n8.2 If the directions sought by the receiver are unlikely to be contentious or important to the parties, he may make the application by letter, and the court may reply by letter. In such cases the receiver need not serve his letter or the court's reply on the parties, unless the court orders him to do so.\n\n8.3 Where a receiver applies for directions by letter, the court may direct him to file and serve an application notice.\n\n---\n\nReceiver's remuneration - rule 69.7\n\n9.1 A receiver may only charge for his services if the court gives directions permitting it and specifying how the remuneration is to be determined.\n\n9.2 The court will normally determine the amount of the receiver's remuneration on the basis of the criteria in rule 69.7(4). Parts 44 to 48 (costs) do not apply to the determination of the remuneration of a receiver.\n\n9.3 Unless the court orders otherwise, the receiver will only be paid or be able to recover his remuneration after the amount of it has been determined.\n\n9.4 An application by a receiver for the amount of his remuneration to be determined must be supported by -\n\n(1) written evidence showing -\n\n(a) on what basis the remuneration is claimed; and\n\n(b) that it is justified and in accordance with this Part; and\n\n(2) a certificate signed by the receiver that he considers that the remuneration he claims is reasonable and proportionate.\n\n9.5 The court may, before determining the amount of a receiver's remuneration -\n\n(1) require the receiver to provide further information in support of his claim; and\n\n(2) appoint an assessor under rule 35.15 to assist the court.\n\n9.6 Paragraphs 9.1 to 9.5 do not apply to expenses incurred by a receiver in carrying out his functions. These are accounted for as part of his account for the assets he has recovered, and not dealt with as part of the determination of his remuneration.\n\n---\n\nAccounts - rule 69.8\n\n10.1 When the court gives directions under rule 69.8(1) for the receiver to prepare and serve accounts, it may -\n\n(1) direct the receiver to prepare and serve accounts either by a specified date or at specified intervals; and\n\n(2) specify the persons on whom he must serve the accounts.\n\n10.2 A party should not apply for an order under rule 69.8(2) permitting him to inspect documents in the possession of the receiver, without first asking the receiver to permit such inspection without an order.\n\n10.3 Where the court makes an order under rule 69.8(2), it will normally direct that the receiver must -\n\n(1) permit inspection within 7 days after being served with the order; and\n\n(2) provide a copy of any documents the subject of the order within 7 days after receiving a request for a copy from the party permitted to inspect them, provided that party has undertaken to pay the reasonable cost of making and providing the copy.",

and\n\n(ca) \"judgment or order\" also includes an award enforceable under the Judgments Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast)(1)) as if it were an order or judgment of the court, and in relation to such an award \"the court which made the judgment or order\" means the county court or the High Court.\n\n(d) 'judgment or order for the payment of money' includes a judgment or order for the payment of costs, but does not include a judgment or order for the payment of money into court.\n\n---\n\nApplication for order\n\n---\n\n70.1 A\n\n(1) In this rule, reference to a fine is to a fine imposed under the County Courts Act 1984.\n\n(2) If a fine is not paid in accordance with the order imposing it, the court officer shall, as soon as reasonably possible, report the matter to a judge.\n\n(3) Where a fine is directed to be paid by instalments, default in the payment of any instalment may be taken as if default had been made in payment of the whole of the fine.\n\n(4) If an order is made for payment of a fine to be enforced by warrant of control, the order shall be treated as an application to the court for the issue of the warrant at the time when the order was made.\n\n(5) If a person pays a fine and later gives evidence to satisfy the court that, if the evidence had been given earlier, no fine or a smaller fine would have been imposed, the court may order the whole or part of the fine to be repaid.\n\n---\n\nMethods of enforcing judgments or orders\n\n70.2\n\n(1) Practice Direction 70 sets out methods of enforcing judgments or orders for the payment of money.\n\n(2) A judgment creditor may, except where an enactment, rule or practice direction provides otherwise -\n\n(a) use any method of enforcement which is available; and\n\n(b) use more than one method of enforcement, either at the same time or one after another.\n\nCourt may order act to be done at expense of disobedient party\n\n---\n\n70.2 A\n\n(1) In this rule 'disobedient party' means a party who has not complied with a mandatory order, an injunction or a judgment or order for the specific performance of a contract.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraph (4), if a mandatory order, an injunction or a judgment or order for the specific performance of a contract is not complied with, the court may direct that the act required to be done may, so far as practicable, be done by another person, being-\n\n(a) the party by whom the order or judgment was obtained; or\n\n(b) some other person appointed by the court.\n\n(3) Where paragraph (2) applies-\n\n(a) the costs to another person of doing the act will be borne by the disobedient party\n\n(b) upon the act being done the expenses incurred may be ascertained in such manner as the court directs; and\n\n(c) execution may issue against the disobedient party for the amount so ascertained and for costs.\n\n(4) Paragraph (2) is without prejudice to-\n\n(a) the court's powers under section 39 of the Senior Courts Act 19811;and\n\n(b) the court's powers to punish the disobedient party for contempt.\n\n---\n\nTransfer of proceedings for enforcement\n\n70.3\n\n(1) Subject to rule 83.17, a judgment creditor wishing to enforce a High Court judgment or order in the County Court must apply to the High Court for an order transferring the proceedings.\n\n(2) A practice direction may make provisions about the transfer of proceedings for enforcement.\n\n(Rule 83.19 contains provisions about the transfer of County Court proceedings to the High Court for enforcement.)\n\n---\n\nEnforcement of judgment or order by or against non-party\n\n70.4\n\nIf a judgment or order is given or made in favour of or against a person who is not a party to proceedings, it may be enforced by or against that person by the same methods as if he were a party.\n\nEnforcement of decisions of bodies other than the High Court and the County Court and compromises enforceable by enactment\n\n---\n\n70.5\n\n(1) This rule applies, subject to paragraph (2), where an enactment provides that -\n\n(a) a decision of a court, tribunal, body or person other than the High Court or the County Court; or\n\n(b) a compromise,\n\nmay be enforced as if it were a court order or that any sum of money payable under that decision or compromise may be recoverable as if payable under a court order.\n\n(2) This rule does not apply to -\n\n(a) any judgment to which Part 74 applies;\n\n(b) arbitration awards;\n\n(c) any order to which RSC Order 115 applies; or\n\n(d) proceedings to which Part 75 (traffic enforcement) applies.\n\n(2 A) Unless paragraph (3) applies, a party may enforce the decision or compromise by applying for a specific method of enforcement under Parts 71 to 73, 81, 83, 84 and 89, and Schedule 2 CCR Order 28 and must -\n\n(a) file with the court a copy of the decision or compromise being enforced; and\n\n(b) provide the court with the information required by Practice Direction 70.\n\n(3) If an enactment provides that a decision or compromise is enforceable or a sum of money is recoverable if a court so orders, an application for such an order must be made in accordance with paragraphs (4) to (7 A) of this rule.\n\n(4) The application -\n\n(a) may, unless paragraph (4 A) applies, be made without notice; and\n\n(b) must be made to the court for the district where the person against whom the order is sought, resides or carries on business, unless an enactment, rule or practice direction provides otherwise or the court otherwise orders.\n\n(4 A) Where a compromise requires a person to whom a sum of money is payable under the compromise to do anything in addition to discontinuing or not starting proceedings ('a conditional compromise'), an application under paragraph (4) must be made on notice.\n\n(5) The application notice must -\n\n(a) be in the form; and\n\n(b) contain the information\n\nrequired by Practice Direction 70.\n\n(6) A copy of the decision or compromise must be filed with the application notice.\n\n(7) An application other than in relation to a conditional compromise may be dealt with by a court officer without a hearing.\n\n(7 A) Where an application relates to a conditional compromise, the respondent may oppose it by filing a response within 14 days of service of the application notice and if the respondent -\n\n(a) does not file a response within the time allowed, the court will make the order; or\n\n(b) files a response within the time allowed, the court will make such order as appears appropriate.\n\n(8) If an enactment provides that a decision or compromise may be enforced in the same manner as an order of the High Court if it is registered, any application to the High Court for registration must be made in accordance with Practice Direction 70.\n\n---\n\nEffect of setting aside judgment or order\n\n70.6\n\nIf a judgment or order is set aside, any enforcement of the judgment or order shall cease to have effect unless the court otherwise orders.\n\nDebt respite scheme\n\n---\n\n70.7\n\n(1) A practice direction may make provision for procedure relating to any debt respite scheme established under section 7 of the Financial Guidance and Claims Act 2018(2).\n\n(2) The practice direction may modify or disapply any provision of these Rules as appropriate in relation to such a debt respite scheme.\n\n---\n\nFootnotes\n\n• 1981 c.54.

This will include, in respect of the judgment creditor's fixed costs of the application, the amount which would be allowed to the judgment creditor under rule 45.23 if the whole balance of the judgment debt were recovered.\n\n---\n\nInterim orders relating to bank or building society accounts - rule 72.6(1)-(3)\n\n3.1 A bank or building society served with an interim third party debt order is only required by rule 72.6, unless the order states otherwise -\n\n(1) to retain money in accounts held solely by the judgment debtor (or, if there are joint judgment debtors, accounts held jointly by them or solely by either or any of them); and\n\n(2) to search for and disclose information about such accounts.\n\n3.2 The bank or building society is not required, for example, to retain money in, or disclose information about -\n\n(1) accounts in the joint names of the judgment debtor and another person; or\n\n(2) if the interim order has been made against a firm, accounts in the names of individual members of that firm.\n\n---\n\nAttachment of debts owed by a partnership\n\n3 A.1 This paragraph relates to debts due or accruing due to a judgment creditor from a partnership.\n\n3 A.2 An interim third party debt order under rule 72.4(2) relating to such debts must be served on -\n\n(1) a member of the partnership within the jurisdiction;\n\n(2) a person authorised by a partner; or\n\n(3) some other person having the control or management of the partnership business.\n\n3 A.3 Where an order made under rule 72.4(2) requires a partnership to appear before the court, it will be sufficient for a partner to appear before the court.\n\n---\n\nTransfer\n\n4 The court may, on an application by a judgment debtor who wishes to oppose an application for a third party debt order, transfer it to-\n\n(a) in the High Court, the court for the district; or\n\n(b) in the County Court, the County Court hearing centre serving the address, where the judgment debtor resides carries on business, or to another court.\n\n---\n\nApplications for hardship payment orders - rule 72.7\n\n5.1 The court will treat an application for a hardship payment order as being made -\n\n(1) in the proceedings in which the interim third party debt order was made; and\n\n(2) under the same claim number,\n\nregardless of where the judgment debtor makes the application.\n\n5.2 An application for a hardship payment order will be dealt with by the court to which it is made.\n\n(Rule 72.7(2) provides that an application may be made -\n\n• in High Court proceedings, in the Royal Courts of Justice or to any district registry; and\n• in County Court proceedings, to any County Court hearing centre.)\n\n5.3 If the application is made to a different court from that dealing with the application for a third party debt order -\n\n(1) the application for a third party debt order will not be transferred; but\n\n(2) the court dealing with that application will send copies of -\n\n(a) the application notice; and\n\n(b) the interim third party debt order\n\nto the court hearing the application for a hardship payment order\n\n5.4 Rule 72.7(3) requires an application for a hardship payment order to be served on the judgment creditor at least 2 days before the court is to deal with the application, unless the court orders otherwise. In cases of exceptional urgency the judgment debtor may apply for a hardship payment order without notice to the judgment creditor and a judge will decide whether to -\n\n(1) deal with the application without it being served on the judgment creditor; or\n\n(2) direct it to be served.\n\n5.5 If the judge decides to deal with the application without it being served on the judgment creditor, where possible he will normally -\n\n(1) direct that the judgment creditor be informed of the application; and\n\n(2) give him the opportunity to make representations,\n\nby telephone, fax or other appropriate method of communication.\n\n5.6 The evidence filed by a judgment debtor in support of an application for a hardship payment order should include documentary evidence, for example (if appropriate) bank statements, wage slips and mortgage statements, to prove his financial position and need for the payment.\n\n---\n\nFinal orders relating to building society accounts\n\n6 A final third party debt order will not require a payment which would reduce to less than £1 the amount in a judgment debtor's account with a building society or credit union.",

Warrants where the debtor is a farmer\n\n83.21\n\n(1) This rule applies if-\n\n(a) any of the following warrants has been issued-\n\n(i) a warrant of control;\n\n(ii) any other warrant conferring the power to use the TCG procedure; or\n\n(iii) a warrant of delivery; and\n\n(b) the enforcement agent has reason to believe that the debtor is a farmer.\n\n(2) If requested to do so by the court or enforcement agent, the creditor must provide the court or enforcement agent with an official certificate, dated not more than three days beforehand, of the result of a search at the Land Registry as to the existence of any charge registered against the debtor under the Agricultural Credits Act 192812.\n\n(3) If the creditor fails to provide the official certificate referred to in paragraph (2) within 7 days of receipt of the request, the court, of its own motion or on the application of the enforcement agent, may order the creditor to provide the certificate. Warrants - withdrawal and suspension of warrant at creditor's request\n\n83.22\n\n(1) This rule applies if any of the following warrants has been issued-\n\n(a) a warrant of control;\n\n(b) any other warrant conferring the power to use the TCG procedure; or\n\n(c) a warrant of delivery.\n\n(2) Where a creditor requests the court to withdraw the warrant, subject to the following paragraphs of this rule-\n\n(a) the creditor will be treated as having abandoned the goods; and\n\n(b) the court will mark the warrant as withdrawn by request of the creditor.\n\n(3) Where the request is made in consequence of an application having been made under Part 85, the enforcement power ceases to be exercisable in respect of the goods claimed.\n\n(4) If the court is requested by the creditor to suspend the warrant because of an arrangement with the debtor, the court will mark the warrant as suspended by request of the creditor and the creditor may subsequently apply to the court for it to be re-issued.\n\n(5) Nothing in this rule will prejudice any right of the creditor to apply for the issue of a fresh warrant or will authorise the re-issue of a warrant which has been withdrawn or has expired or has been superseded by the issue of a fresh warrant. Warrants of delivery\n\n83.23\n\n(1) In this rule 'warrant of specific delivery' means a warrant to recover goods without alternative provision for recovery of their value.\n\n(2) Except where an act or rule provides otherwise, a judgment or order for the delivery of any goods will be enforceable by warrant of delivery in accordance with this rule.\n\n(3) If the judgment or order does not give the person against whom it was given or made the alternative of paying the value of the goods, it may be enforced by a warrant of specific delivery.\n\n(4) If the judgment or order is for the delivery of the goods or payment of their value, it may be enforced by a warrant of delivery to recover the goods or their value.\n\n(5) Where a warrant of delivery is issued, the creditor will be entitled, by the same or a separate warrant, to execution against the debtor's goods for any money payable under the judgment or order which is to be enforced by the warrant of delivery.\n\n(6) Where-\n\n(a) a judgment or order is given or made for the delivery of goods or payment of their value; and\n\n(b) a warrant is issued to recover the goods or their value,\n\nmoney paid into court under the warrant will be appropriated first to any sum of money and costs awarded. Warrants of delivery other than those conferring a power to use the TCG procedure - notice and inventory requirements\n\n83.24\n\n(1) This rule applies where-\n\n(a) a warrant of delivery has been issued for the whole or part of a sum of money and costs; and\n\n(b) the warrant does not confer power to use the TCG procedure.\n\n(2) Unless the court orders otherwise, the enforcement agent-\n\n(a) must serve the debtor with a notice warning of the warrant; and\n\n(b) must not levy the warrant until at least 7 days after service of the notice.\n\n(3) Upon levying execution of the warrant, the enforcement agent must leave notice of the warrant at the place where it has been executed.\n\n(4) If the enforcement agent removes the goods, the enforcement agent must deliver or send to the debtor an inventory of the goods removed sufficient for the debtor to identify the goods.\n\n(5) The inventory must be delivered or sent to the debtor within 7 days of the goods being seized by-\n\n(a) delivery to the debtor personally;\n\n(b) sending the inventory by post to the debtor's place of residence; or\n\n(c) where the debtor's place of residence is not known, by leaving the inventory for, or sending it to, the debtor at the place from which the goods were removed.\n\n(6) If the enforcement agent fails to supply an inventory in accordance with this rule, the debtor may make an application to the court using the procedure in Part 23, for an order requiring the enforcement agent to do so. Warrants of delivery conferring a power to use the TCG procedure - notice of enforcement and inventory requirements\n\n83.25\n\n(1) Where a warrant of delivery confers the power to use the TCG procedure, this rule applies in relation to the parts of the warrant that do not confer that power.\n\n(2) Subject to paragraph (4), the enforcement agent must send a warning notice to the person against whom the warrant is issued not less than 7 clear days before the enforcement agent executes the warrant.\n\n(3) Where the period referred to in paragraph (2) includes a Sunday, bank holiday, Good Friday or Christmas Day, that day does not count in calculating that period.\n\n(4) The court may order that a specified shorter period of notice be given to the debtor.\n\n(5) The enforcement agent may apply for the order by way of application under Part 23 and may make the application as part of an application under rule 84.4.\n\n(6) Upon executing the warrant, the enforcement agent must give to the debtor or leave for the debtor at the place where the warrant is being executed, notice about the execution.\n\n(7) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within 7 days of execution of the warrant, the enforcement agent must provide the debtor with a written inventory of goods taken with a description of the goods to enable the debtor to identify the goods correctly.\n\n(8) If the enforcement agent fails to provide-\n\n(a) notice of execution under paragraph (6); or\n\n(b) an inventory under paragraph (7) within 7 days of execution,\n\nthe debtor may make an application to the court under Part 23 for an order requiring the enforcement agent to supply the notice or inventory as appropriate.\n\n(Regulations 6 and 30 to 33 of the TCG Regulations contain notice and inventory requirements that apply in relation to the use of the TCG procedure.) Warrants of possession\n\n83.26\n\n(1) A judgment or order for the recovery of land will be enforceable by warrant of possession.\n\n(2) An application for a warrant of possession-\n\n(a) may be made without notice; and\n\n(b) must be made to-\n\n(i) the County Court hearing centre where the judgment or order which it is sought to enforce was made; or\n\n(ii) the County Court hearing centre to which the proceedings have since been transferred.\n\n(3) The court may, on an application by a debtor who wishes to oppose an application for a warrant of possession, transfer it to the County Court hearing centre serving the address where the debtor resides or carries on business, or to another court.\n\n(4) Without prejudice to paragraph (7), the person applying for a warrant of possession must file a certificate that the land which is subject of the judgment or order has not been vacated.\n\n(5) When applying for a warrant of possession of a dwelling-house subject to a mortgage, the claimant must certify that notice has been given in accordance with the Dwelling Houses (Execution of Possession Orders by Mortgagees) Regulations 201013.\n\n(6) Where a warrant of possession is issued, the creditor will be entitled, by the same or a separate warrant, to execution against the debtor's goods for any money payable under the judgment or order which is to be enforced by the warrant of possession.\n\n(7) In a case to which paragraph (6) applies or where an order for possession has been suspended on terms as to payment of a sum of money by instalments, the creditor must in the request certify-\n\n(a) the amount of money remaining due under the judgment or order; and\n\n(b) that the whole or part of any instalment due remains unpaid.\n\n(8) A warrant of restitution may be issued, with the permission of the court, in aid of any warrant of possession.\n\n(9) An application for permission under paragraph (8) may be made without notice being served on any other party and must be supported by evidence of-\n\n(a)wrongful re-entry into possession following the execution of the warrant of possession; and\n\n(b) such further facts as would, in the High Court, enable the creditor to have a writ of restitution issued.\n\n(10) A warrant of possession to enforce an order for possession in a possession claim against a trespasser under Part 55 ('a warrant of possession against a trespasser') may be issued at any time after the date on which possession is ordered to be given.\n\n(11) No warrant of possession against a trespasser may be issued after the expiry of 3 months from the date of the order without the permission of the court.\n\n(12) Unless the court otherwise directs, an application for permission under paragraph (11) may be made without notice to any other party. Saving for enforcement by contempt proceedings\n\n83.27 Nothing in rules 83.23 and 83.26 prejudices any right to bring contempt proceedings under Part 81. Suspension of part warrant\n\n83.28\n\n(1) This rule applies where a warrant issued for part of a sum of money and costs payable under a judgment or order is suspended on payment of instalments.\n\n(2) Unless the court otherwise directs, the judgment or order will be treated as suspended on those terms as respects the whole of the sum of money and costs then remaining unpaid. Concurrent warrants\n\n83.29 Two or more warrants of control may be issued concurrently for execution by two or more different enforcement agents, but-\n\n(a) no more may be levied under all the warrants together than is authorised to be levied under one of them; and\n\n(b) unless the court orders otherwise, the costs of more than one warrant will not be allowed against the debtor.

and\n\n(b) the court makes or is notified of the making of another attachment of earnings order (\"the second order\")-\n\n(i) which is against the same debtor; and\n\n(ii) which is not to secure the payment of a judgment debt or payments under an administration order.\n\n(5) The court may discharge or vary the first order, having regard to the priority accorded to the second order by paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 of the 1971 Act.\n\n(6) Paragraph (7) applies where the court makes an attachment of earnings order and then makes-\n\n(a) an administration order;

and\n\n(b) the alleged offender is not being proceeded against summarily.\n\n(2) The District Judge may issue a notice to the alleged offender to show cause why that alleged offender should not be punished for the alleged offence.\n\n(3) The notice must be served on the alleged offender personally not less than 14 days before the hearing.\n\n\"4) In paragraphs (5) to (8), reference to a fine is to a fine imposed as the result of an offence under section 23(2) of the 1971 Act.\n\n(5) If a fine is not paid in accordance with the order imposing it, the court officer shall, as soon as reasonably possible, report the matter to a judge.\n\n(6) Where a fine is directed to be paid by instalments, default in the payment of any instalment may be taken as if default had been made in payment of the whole of the fine.\n\n(7) If an order is made for payment of a fine to be enforced by warrant of control, the order shall be treated as an application to the court for the issue of the warrant at the time when the order was made.\n\n(8) If a person pays a fine and later gives evidence to satisfy the court that, if the evidence had been given earlier, no fine or a smaller fine would have been imposed, the court may order the whole or part of the fine to be repaid.\n\n---\n\nSECTION III - CONSOLIDATED ATTACHMENT ORDERS\n\n---\n\nCases in which consolidated attachment order may be made\n\n89.18 Subject to the provisions of rules 89.19 to 89.21, the court may make a consolidated attachment order where-\n\n(a) two or more attachment of earnings orders are in force to secure the payment of judgment debts by the same debtor; or\n\n(b) on an application for an attachment of earnings order to secure the payment of a judgment debt, or for a consolidated attachment order to secure the payment of two or more judgment debts, it appears to the court that an attachment of earnings order is already in force to secure the payment of a judgment debt by the same debtor.\n\n---\n\nApplication for consolidated attachment order\n\n89.19\n\n(1) In this rule, \"a party affected by the application\" means-\n\n(a) where the application is made by the debtor, the creditor in the proceedings in which the application is made and any other creditor who has obtained an attachment of earnings order which is in force to secure the payment of a judgment debt by the debtor;\n\n(b) where the application is made by the creditor, the debtor and every person who, to the knowledge of the applicant, has obtained an attachment of earnings order which is in force to secure the payment of a judgment debt by the debtor.\n\n(2) An application for a consolidated attachment order may be made-\n\n(a) by the debtor in respect of whom the order is sought; or\n\n(b) by any person who has obtained or is entitled to apply for an attachment of earnings order to secure the payment of a judgment debt by that debtor.\n\n(3) An application under paragraph (2) may be made in the proceedings in which any attachment of earnings order is in force and rules 89.3, 89.4 and 89.5 do not apply.\n\n(4) Where an attachment of earnings order has been made-\n\n(a) at the Civil National Business Centre an application under paragraph (2) must be made to the debtor's home court;\n\n(b) at a County Court hearing centre, an application under paragraph (2) must be made to that hearing centre.\n\n(5) An application under paragraph (2)(b) must-\n\n(a) include a certificate as to the amount of money remaining due under the judgment or order and that the whole or part of any instalment due remains unpaid;

    "id": "Practice Direction – Pre-Action Conduct and Protocols",
    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION - PRE-ACTION CONDUCT AND PROTOCOLS\n\n---\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.Pre-action protocols explain the conduct and set out the steps the court would normally expect parties to take before commencing proceedings for particular types of civil claims. They are approved by the Master of the Rolls and are annexed to the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR). (The current pre-action protocols are listed in paragraph 18.)\n\n2.This Practice Direction applies to disputes where no pre-action protocol approved by the Master of the Rolls applies.A person who knowingly makes a false statement in a pre-action protocol letter or other document prepared in anticipation of legal proceedings may be subject to proceedings for contempt of court.\n\n---\n\nObjectives of pre-action conduct and protocols\n\n3.Before commencing proceedings, the court will expect the parties to have exchanged sufficient information to-(a) understand each other's position;\n\n(b) make decisions about how to proceed;\n\n(c) try to settle the issues without proceedings;\n\n(d) consider a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to assist with settlement;\n\n(e) support the efficient management of those proceedings; and\n\n(f) reduce the costs of resolving the dispute.\n\n---\n\nProportionality\n\n4.A pre-action protocol or this Practice Direction must not be used by a party as a tactical device to secure an unfair advantage over another party. Only reasonable and proportionate steps should be taken by the parties to identify, narrow and resolve the legal, factual or expert issues.\n\n5.The costs incurred in complying with a pre-action protocol or this Practice Direction should be proportionate (CPR 44.3(5)). Where parties incur disproportionate costs in complying with any pre-action protocol or this Practice Direction, those costs will not be recoverable as part of the costs of the proceedings.\n\n---\n\nSteps before issuing a claim at court\n\n6.Where there is a relevant pre-action protocol, the parties should comply with that protocol before commencing proceedings. Where there is no relevant pre-action protocol, the parties should exchange correspondence and information to comply with the objectives in paragraph 3, bearing in mind that compliance should be proportionate. The steps will usually include-\n\n(a) the claimant writing to the defendant with concise details of the claim. The letter should include the basis on which the claim is made, a summary of the facts, what the claimant wants from the defendant, and if money, how the amount is calculated;\n\n(b) the defendant responding within a reasonable time - 14 days in a straight forward case and no more than 3 months in a very complex one. The reply should include confirmation as to whether the claim is accepted and, if it is not accepted, the reasons why, together with an explanation as to which facts and parts of the claim are disputed and whether the defendant is making a counterclaim as well as providing details of any counterclaim; and\n\n(c) the parties disclosing key documents relevant to the issues in dispute.\n\n---\n\nExperts\n\n7.Parties should be aware that the court must give permission before expert evidence can be relied upon (see CPR 35.4(1)) and that the court may limit the fees recoverable. Many disputes can be resolved without expert advice or evidence. If it is necessary to obtain expert evidence, particularly in low value claims, the parties should consider using a single expert, jointly instructed by the parties, with the costs shared equally.\n\n---\n\nSettlement and ADR\n\n8.Litigation should be a last resort. As part of a relevant pre-action protocol or this Practice Direction, the parties should consider whether negotiation or some other form of ADR might enable them to settle their dispute without commencing proceedings.\n\n9.Parties should continue to consider the possibility of reaching a settlement at all times, including after proceedings have been started. Part 36 offers may be made before proceedings are issued.\n\n10.Parties may negotiate to settle a dispute or may use a form of ADR including-\n\n(a) mediation, a third party facilitating a resolution;\n\n(b) arbitration, a third party deciding the dispute;\n\n(c) early neutral evaluation, a third party giving an informed opinion on the dispute; and\n\n(d) Ombudsmen schemes.(Information on mediation and other forms of ADR is available in the Jackson ADR Handbook (available from Oxford University Press) or at-\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/a-guide-to-civil-mediation\n\n11.If proceedings are issued, the parties may be required by the court to provide evidence that ADR has been considered. A party's silence in response to an invitation to participate or a refusal to participate in ADR might be considered unreasonable by the court and could lead to the court ordering that party to pay additional court costs.\n\n---\n\nStocktake and list of issues\n\n12.Where a dispute has not been resolved after the parties have followed a pre-action protocol or this Practice Direction, they should review their respective positions. They should consider the papers and the evidence to see if proceedings can be avoided and at least seek to narrow the issues in dispute before the claimant issues proceedings.\n\n---\n\nCompliance with this Practice Direction and the Protocols\n\n13.If a dispute proceeds to litigation, the court will expect the parties to have complied with a relevant pre-action protocol or this Practice Direction. The court will take into account non-compliance when giving directions for the management of proceedings (see CPR 3.1(4) to (6)) and when making orders for costs (see CPR 44.3(5)(a)). The court will consider whether all parties have complied in substance with the terms of the relevant pre-action protocol or this Practice Direction and is not likely to be concerned with minor or technical infringements, especially when the matter is urgent (for example an application for an injunction).\n\n14.The court may decide that there has been a failure of compliance when a party has-\n\n(a) not provided sufficient information to enable the objectives in paragraph 3 to be met;\n\n(b) not acted within a time limit set out in a relevant protocol, or within a reasonable period; or\n\n(c) unreasonably refused to use a form of ADR, or failed to respond at all to an invitation to do so.\n\n15.Where there has been non-compliance with a pre-action protocol or this Practice Direction, the court may order that\n\n(a) the parties are relieved of the obligation to comply or further comply with the pre-action protocol or this Practice Direction;\n\n(b) the proceedings are stayed while particular steps are taken to comply with the pre-action protocol or this Practice Direction;\n\n(c) sanctions are to be applied.\n\n16.The court will consider the effect of any non-compliance when deciding whether to impose any sanctions which may include-\n\n(a) an order that the party at fault pays the costs of the proceedings, or part of the costs of the other party or parties;\n\n(b) an order that the party at fault pay those costs on an indemnity basis;\n\n(c) if the party at fault is a claimant who has been awarded a sum of money, an order depriving that party of interest on that sum for a specified period, and/or awarding interest at a lower rate than would otherwise have been awarded;\n\n(d) if the party at fault is a defendant, and the claimant has been awarded a sum of money, an order awarding interest on that sum for a specified period at a higher rate, (not exceeding 10% above base rate), than the rate which would otherwise have been awarded.\n\n---\n\nLimitation\n\n17.This Practice Direction and the pre-action protocols do not alter the statutory time limits for starting court proceedings. If a claim is issued after the relevant limitation period has expired, the defendant will be entitled to use that as a defence to the claim. If proceedings are started to comply with the statutory time limit before the parties have followed the procedures in this Practice Direction or the relevant pre-action protocol, the parties should apply to the court for a stay of the proceedings while they so comply.\n\n---\n\nProtocols in force\n\n18.The table sets out the protocols currently in force and from which date.",

Distribution of business\n\n3.1 In the High Court, all petitions and applications, save where paragraph 3.2 below provides otherwise, should be listed for an initial hearing before an ICC Judge in the Royal Courts of Justice, or a District Judge Sitting in a District Registry.\n\n3.2 The following applications relating to insolvent companies or insolvent individuals must be listed before a High Court Judge:\n\n(1) applications for committal for contempt; and\n\n(2) applications for a search order (CPR 25.1(1)(h)) and a freezing order (CPR 25.1(1)(f)).\n\n3.3 The following applications relating to insolvent companies or insolvent individuals may be listed before a High Court Judge or ICC Judge but, subject to paragraph 3.4 below, not before a District Judge Sitting in a District Registry or a District Judge:\n\n(1) applications for an administration order;\n\n(2) applications for an injunction pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction (e.g. to restrain the presentation or advertisement of a winding up petition);\n\n(3) interim applications and applications for directions or case management after any proceedings have been referred or adjourned to the High Court Judge;\n\n(4) applications for the appointment of a provisional liquidator; and\n\n(5) applications for an injunction (other than those referred to in paragraph 3.2(2) above) pursuant to s.37 of the Senior Courts Act 1981, including an ancillary order under CPR 25.1(1)(g).\n\n3.4 The following applications relating to insolvent companies or insolvent individuals may be listed before a District Judge Sitting in a District Registry only with the consent of the Supervising Judge for the circuit in which the District Judge is sitting, or with the consent of the Supervising Judge's nominee:\n\n(1) applications pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction (e.g. to restrain the presentation or advertisement of a winding up petition);\n\n(2) interim applications and applications for directions or case management after any proceedings have been referred or adjourned to a High Court Judge.\n\n3.5 When deciding whether to hear and determine proceedings or to refer or adjourn them to a different level of judge, regard must be had to the following factors:\n\n(1) whether the proceedings raise new or controversial points of law or have wide public interest implications;\n\n(2) which venue can provide the earliest date for the hearing;\n\n(3) the likely length of the hearing; and/or\n\n(4) whether the petition or application includes or is likely to include matters that must be heard by a High Court Judge under paragraph 3.2 above.\n\n3.6 Where an application or petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, or any application or petition within existing insolvency proceedings, is issued in a County Court hearing centre having insolvency jurisdiction, unless the application or petition is Local Business, the application or petition but more usually the entirety of those insolvency proceedings shall be transferred:\n\n(a) to a County Court hearing centre having insolvency jurisdiction located at a Business and Property Court in the same circuit; or\n\n(b) to the Central London County Court if the application or petition was issued in a County Court hearing centre located in the South-Eastern circuit; or\n\n(c) to one of the specialist centres specified in a list published from time to time by the Chancellor of the High Court or their nominee, and located in the same circuit as the hearing centre in which the application or petition was issued,\n\nand be listed before a judge specialising in Business and Property Courts work as defined in paragraph 4.4 of the Business and Property Courts Practice Direction (the \"specialist judge\"). (The current list of specified specialist centres may be found at https://www.judiciary.uk/insolvency-proceedings-practice-direction-specified-specialist-hearing-centres/).\n\n3.7 For the purpose of paragraph 3.6 Local Business means (i) applications to set aside statutory demands; (ii) unopposed creditors' winding up petitions; (iii) unopposed bankruptcy petitions; (iv) applications for income payment orders; (v) applications for and the conduct of public and private examinations; (vi) warrants for arrest in connection with the conduct of public or private examinations; (vii) claims for possession by an office-holder against a bankrupt (whether or not the bankrupt has been discharged); (viii) claims falling under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 (notwithstanding the application of section 335 A of the Act); (ix) claims for the granting or enforcement of charging orders pursuant to section 313 of the Act; (x) unopposed applications by the Official Receiver to suspend discharge from bankruptcy, and if the application transpires to be opposed, any application by the Official Receiver for an interim suspension pending the matter being heard following its transfer pursuant to paragraph 3.6 above; and (xi) applications for debt relief orders under Part 7 A of the Act Such Local Business may be heard and determined by any judge in the County Court hearing centre in which those insolvency proceedings were issued, unless such a judge considers that it would be appropriate to transfer them in accordance with paragraph 3.6 in any event.\n\n3.8 Where insolvency proceedings are transferred under paragraph 3.6 or 3.7, they shall be listed for review on paper before a specialist judge in the receiving court as soon as possible. The specialist judge shall determine of their own initiative where the application (or any part of it) can most fairly be determined having regard to (i) the nature and complexity of the issues; (ii) the amounts involved in the insolvency proceedings or insolvency application; (iii) the location and needs of the parties; (iv) the available judicial resources; and (v) all the other circumstances of the case. The specialist judge shall take into account any views of the transferring judge and those of the parties to the application expressed in writing (without the need for evidence).\n\n3.9 The options available to the specialist judge include (but are not limited to):\n\n(a) Retaining the entirety of the insolvency proceedings in the receiving court;\n\n(b) Retaining the entirety of the insolvency proceedings in the receiving court but fixing the venue of any hearing before a specialist judge at some other hearing centre or by some means other than a physical hearing;\n\n(c) Returning the insolvency proceedings to the sending court to be dealt with as if it were Local Business;\n\n(d) Retaining the insolvency proceedings in the receiving court but transferring some part back for hearing or for management and hearing in the sending court as if it were Local Business.\n\n3.10 The case management decision about transfer shall be recorded in an order made of the specialist judge's own initiative. 4. Court documents\n\n4.1 All insolvency proceedings should be commenced and applications in insolvency proceedings should be made using the information prescribed by the Act, Insolvency Rules, the Business and Property Courts Practice Direction and/or other legislation under which the same is or are brought or made. Some forms relating to insolvency proceedings may be found at:\n\nhttp://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/Get Forms.do?court_forms_category=Bankruptcy%20 and%20 Insolvency 5. Service of Court documents in insolvency proceedings\n\n5.1 Schedule 4 to the Insolvency Rules prescribes the requirements for service where a Court document is required to be served pursuant to the Act or the Insolvency Rules. Pursuant to Schedule 4, CPR Part 6 applies except where Schedule 4 provides otherwise, or the court otherwise approves or directs.\n\n5.2 Subject to the Court approving or directing otherwise, CPR Part 6 applies to the service of Court documents both within and out of the jurisdiction.\n\n5.3 Attention is drawn to paragraph 6 of Schedule 4 to the Insolvency Rules which provides that where the Court has directed that service be effected in a particular manner, the certificate of service must be accompanied by a sealed copy of the order directing such manner of service.\n\n5.4 The provisions of CPR Part 6 are modified by Schedule 4 to the Insolvency Rules in respect of certain documents. Reference should be made to the \"Table of requirements for service\" in Schedule 4. Notable modifications relate to the service of: (a) a winding up petition; and (b) an application for an administration order.\n\n5.5 A statutory demand is not a Court document. 6. Drawing up of orders\n\n6.1 The parties are responsible for drawing up all orders, unless the Court directs otherwise. Attention is drawn to CPRPD 40 B 1.2 and the Chancery Guide. All applications should be accompanied by draft orders. 7. Urgent applications\n\n7.1 In the Royal Courts of Justice the ICC Judges and the High Court Judges (and in other Courts exercising insolvency jurisdiction the High Court Judges, District Judges Sitting in a District Registry and District Judges) will hear urgent applications and time-critical applications as soon as reasonably practicable. This may involve delaying the hearing of another matter. Accordingly, parties asking for an application to be dealt with urgently must be able to justify the urgency with reasons. PART TWO: COMPANY INSOLVENCY 8. Administrations\n\n8.1 Attention is drawn to paragraph 2.1 of the Electronic Practice Direction 51 O -The Electronic Working Pilot Scheme, or to any subsequent Electronic Practice Direction made after the date of this IPD, where a notice of appointment is made using the electronic filing system. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the restriction in sub-paragraph (c) to notices of appointment made by qualifying floating charge holders, paragraph 2.1 of the Electronic Practice Direction 51 O shall not apply to any filing of a notice of appointment of an administrator outside Court opening hours, and the provisions of Insolvency Rules 3.20 to 3.22 shall in those circumstances continue to apply.\n\n8.2 Paragraph 5.4 of the Electronic Practice Direction 510 provides that 'the date and time of payment' will be the filing date and time and 'it will also be the date and time of issue for all claim forms and other originating processes submitted using Electronic Working'.\n\n8.3 In the absence of special circumstances, an application for the extension of an administration should be made not less than one month before the end of the administration. The evidence in support of any later application must explain why the application is being made late. The Court will consider whether any part of the costs should be disallowed where an application is made less than one month before the end of the administration. 9. Winding up petitions\n\n9.1.Where a winding up petition is presented following service of a statutory demand, the statutory demand must contain the information set out in rule 7.3 of the Insolvency Rules and should, as far as possible, follow the form which appears at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/demand-immediate-payment-of-a-debt-from-a-limited-company-form-sd 1.\n\n9.2 Before presenting a winding up petition, the creditor must conduct a search to ensure that no petition is pending. Save in exceptional circumstances a second winding up petition should not be presented whilst a prior petition is pending. A petitioner who presents a petition while another petition is pending does so at risk as to costs.\n\n9.3 Payment of the fee and deposit\n\n9.3.1 Unless the petition is one in respect of which rule 7.7(2)(b) of the Insolvency Rules applies, a winding up petition will not be treated as having been presented until the Court fee and official receiver's deposit have been paid.\n\n9.3.2 A petition filed electronically without payment of the deposit will be marked \"private\" and will not be available for inspection until the deposit has been paid. The date of presentation of the petition will accord with the date on which the deposit has been paid. If the official receiver's deposit is not paid within 7 calendar days after filing the petition, the petition will not be accepted, in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of the Electronic Practice Direction 510 -The Electronic Working Pilot Scheme. If a petition is not accepted, a new petition will have to be filed if the petitioner wishes to wind up a company.\n\n9.3.3 The deposit will be taken by the Court and forwarded to the official receiver. In the Royal Courts of Justice the petition fee and deposit should be paid by cheque, or by debit or credit card over the phone. The Court will record the receipt and will impress two entries on the original petition, one in respect of the Court fee and the other in respect of the deposit. In a District Registry or a County Court hearing centre, the petition fee and deposit should be paid to the staff of the duly authorised officer of the Court, who will record its receipt.\n\n9.3.4 If payment is made by cheque, it should be made payable to 'HM Courts and Tribunals Service' or 'HMCTS'. For the purposes of paragraph 9.3 of this IPD, the deposit will be treated as paid when the cheque is received by the Court.\n\n9.4 Save where by reason of the nature of the company or its place of incorporation the information cannot be stated (in which case as much similar information as is available should be given), every creditor's winding up petition must (in the case of a company) contain the information set out in rule 7.5. Similar information (so far as is appropriate) should be given where the petition is presented against a partnership.\n\n9.5 Where the petitioning creditor relies on failure to pay a debt, details of the debt relied on should be given in the petition (whether or not they have been given in any statutory demand served in respect of the debt), including the amount of the debt, its nature and the date or dates on or between which it was incurred.\n\n9.6 The statement of truth verifying the petition in accordance with rule 7.6 should be made no more than ten business days before the date of issue of the petition.\n\n9.7 Where the company to be wound up has been struck off the register, the petition should state that fact and include as part of the relief sought an order that it be restored to the register. Save where the petition has been presented by a Minister of the Crown or a government department, evidence of service on the Government Legal Department or the Solicitor for the Affairs of the Duchy of Lancaster or the Solicitor to the Duchy of Cornwall (as appropriate) should be filed exhibiting the bona vacantia waiver letter. 9.8 Notice of the petition\n\n9.8.1 The provisions contained in Chapter 4 of Part 1 and in particular rule 7.10 must be followed (unless waived by the Court). These provisions are designed to preserve the sanctity of the class remedy in any given winding up by the Court. Failure to comply with rule 7.10 may lead to summary dismissal of the petition on the return date. If the Court, in its discretion, grants an adjournment, this will usually be on terms that notice of the petition is gazetted or otherwise given in accordance with the Insolvency Rules in due time for the adjourned hearing. No further adjournment to comply with rule 7.10 will normally be given.\n\n9.8.2 Copies of every notice gazetted in connection with a winding up petition, or where this is not practicable a description of the form and content of the notice, must be lodged with the Court as soon as possible after publication and in any event not later than five business days before the hearing of the petition. This direction applies even if the notice is defective in any way (e.g. is published on a date not in accordance with the Insolvency Rules, or omits or misprints some important words) or if the petitioner decides not to pursue the petition (e.g. on receiving payment).\n\n9.8.3 Attention is drawn to the requirement to give notice of the dismissal of a petition under rule 7.23(1). The Court will usually, on request, dispense with the requirement where (a) presentation of the petition has not previously been gazetted or (b) the company has become the subject of some supervening insolvency process, or (c) the company consents. 9.9 Errors in petitions\n\n9.9.1 Applications for permission to amend errors in petitions which are discovered after a winding up order has been made should be made to the member of Court staff in charge of the winding up list in the Royal Courts of Justice or to a District Judge Sitting in a District Registry or District Judge.\n\n9.9.2 Where the error is an error in the name of the company, the member of Court staff in charge of the winding up list in the Royal Courts of Justice or a District Judge Sitting in a District Registry or District Judge may make any necessary amendments to ensure that the winding up order is drawn up with the correct name of the company inserted. If there is any doubt, e.g. where there might be another company in existence which could be confused with the company to be wound up, the member of Court staff in charge of the winding up list will refer the application to an ICC Judge at the Royal Courts of Justice. A District Judge Sitting in a District Registry or District Judge may refer the matter to a High Court Judge.\n\n9.9.3 Where it is discovered that the company has been struck off the Register of Companies prior to the winding up order being made, the petition must be restored to the list as soon as possible to enable an order for the restoration of the name to be made as well as the order to wind up and, save where the petition has been presented by a Minister of the Crown or a government department, evidence of service on the Government Legal Department or the Solicitor for the Affairs of the Duchy of Lancaster or the Solicitor to the Duchy of Cornwall (as appropriate) should be filed exhibiting the bona vacantia waiver letter. 9.10 Rescission of a winding up order\n\n9.10.1 A request to rescind a winding up order must be made by application.\n\n9.10.2 The application must be made within five business days after the date on which the order was made, failing which it should include an application to extend time pursuant to Schedule 5 to the Insolvency Rules. Notice of any such application must be given to the petitioning creditor, any supporting or opposing creditor, any incumbent insolvency practitioner and the official receiver.\n\n9.10.3 An application to rescind will only be entertained if made by a (a) creditor, or (b) contributory, or (c) by the company jointly with a creditor or with a contributory. The application must be supported by a witness statement which should include details of assets and liabilities and (where appropriate) reasons for any failure to apply within five business days.\n\n9.10.4 In the case of an unsuccessful application, the costs of the petitioning creditor, any supporting or opposing creditor, any incumbent insolvency practitioner and the official receiver will normally be ordered to be paid by the creditor or the contributory making or joining in the application. The reason for this is that if the costs of an unsuccessful application are made payable by the company, those costs will inevitably fall on the general body of creditors. 9.11 Validation orders",

    "content": "Document: Insolvency Proceedings\nPart 2 of 3\n==================================================\n9.11.1 A company against which a winding up petition has been presented may apply to the Court after the presentation of a petition for relief from the effects of s.127(1) of the Act, by seeking an order that a certain disposition or dispositions of its property, including payments out of its bank account (whether such account is in credit or overdrawn), shall not be void in the event of a winding up order being made at the hearing of the petition (a validation order).\n\n9.11.2 Save in exceptional circumstances, notice of the making of the application should be given to: (a) the petitioning creditor; (b) any person entitled to receive a copy of the petition pursuant to rule 7.9; (c) any creditor who has given notice to the petitioner of their intention to appear on the hearing of the petition pursuant to rule 7.14; and (d) any creditor who has been substituted as petitioner pursuant to rule 7.17. Failure to do so is likely to lead to an adjournment of the application or dismissal.\n\n9.11.3 The application should be supported by a witness statement which should be made by a director or officer of the company who is intimately acquainted with the company's affairs and financial circumstances. If appropriate, supporting evidence in the form of a witness statement from the company's accountant should also be produced.\n\n9.11.4 The extent and content of the evidence will vary according to the circumstances and the nature of the relief sought, but in the majority of cases it should include, as a minimum, the following information:\n\n(1) when and to whom notice has been given in accordance with paragraph 9.11.2 above;\n\n(2) the company's registered office;\n\n(3) the company's capital;\n\n(4) brief details of the circumstances leading to presentation of the petition;\n\n(5) how the company became aware of presentation of the petition;\n\n(6) whether the petition debt is admitted or disputed and, if the latter, brief details of the basis on which the debt is disputed;\n\n(7) full details of the company's financial position including details of its assets (and including details of any security and the amount(s) secured) and liabilities, which should be supported, as far as possible, by documentary evidence, e.g. the latest filed accounts, any draft audited accounts, management accounts or estimated statement of affairs;\n\n(8) a cash flow forecast and profit and loss projection for the period for which the order is sought;\n\n(9) details of the dispositions or payments in respect of which an order is sought;\n\n(10) the reasons relied on in support of the need for such dispositions or payments to be made prior to the hearing of the petition;\n\n(11) any other information relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion;\n\n(12) details of any consents obtained from the persons mentioned in paragraph 9.11.2 above (supported by documentary evidence where appropriate);\n\n(13) details of any relevant bank account, including its number and the address and sort code of the bank at which such account is held, and the amount of the credit or debit balance on such account at the time of making the application.\n\n9.11.5 Where an application is made urgently to enable payments to be made which are essential to continued trading (e.g. wages) and it is not possible to assemble all the evidence listed above, the Court may consider granting limited relief for a short period, but there should be sufficient evidence to satisfy the Court that the interests of creditors are unlikely to be prejudiced by the grant of limited relief.\n\n9.11.6 Where the application involves a disposition of property, the Court will need details of the property (including its title number if the property is land) and to be satisfied that any proposed disposal will be at a proper value. Accordingly, an independent valuation should be obtained and exhibited to the evidence.\n\n9.11.7 The Court will need to be satisfied by credible evidence either that the company is solvent and able to pay its debts as they fall due or that a particular transaction or series of transactions in respect of which the order is sought will be beneficial to or will not prejudice the interests of all the unsecured creditors as a class.\n\n9.11.8 A draft of the order sought should be attached to the application.\n\n9.11.9 Similar considerations to those set out above are likely to apply to applications seeking ratification of a transaction or payment after the making of a winding up order. 10. Applications\n\n10.1 In accordance with rule 12.2(2), in the Royal Courts of Justice an officer acting on behalf of the operations manager or chief clerk has been authorised to deal with applications:\n\n(1) to extend or abridge time prescribed by the Insolvency Rules in connection with winding up;\n\n(2) for permission to withdraw a winding up petition (rule 7.13);\n\n(3) made by the official receiver for a public examination (s.133(1)(c) of the Act), where no penal notice is endorsed and no unless order is made;\n\n(4) made by the official receiver to transfer proceedings from the High Court to a specified hearing centre within the meaning of rule 12.30;\n\n(5) to list a hearing for directions with a time estimate of 30 minutes or less in circumstances where both parties are represented without reference to an ICC Judge;\n\n(6) for a first extension of time to serve a bankruptcy petition.\n\n10.2 Outside of the Royal Courts of Justice, applications listed in paragraph 10.1 must be made to a District Judge Sitting in a District Registry or in the County Court to a District Judge.\n\n10.3 Where an application is made by an official receiver in respect of the matters listed in paragraph 10.1(4) above, the official receiver must comply with rule 12.32 and give any incumbent office-holder 14 days' written notice of the application. PART THREE: PERSONAL INSOLVENCY 11. Statutory demands\n\n11.1 Rule 10.1 prescribes the contents of a statutory demand. An example of a statutory demand may be found at:\n\nhttp://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/Get Forms.do?court_forms_category=Bankruptcy%20 and%20 Insolvency\n\n11.2. Rule 10.2 applies to service of a statutory demand whether within or out of the jurisdiction. If personal service is not practicable in the particular circumstances, a creditor must do all that is reasonable to bring the statutory demand to the debtor's attention. This could include taking those steps set out at paragraph 12.7 below which justify the Court making an order for service of a bankruptcy petition other than by personal service. It may also include any other form of physical or electronic communication which will bring the statutory demand to the notice of the debtor.\n\n11.3 A creditor wishing to serve a statutory demand out of the jurisdiction in a foreign country with an applicable civil procedure convention (including the Hague Convention) may and, if the assistance of a British Consul is desired, must adopt the procedure prescribed by CPR rule 6.42 and CPR rule 6.43. In the case of any doubt whether the country is a 'convention country', enquiries should be made of the Foreign Process Section of the King's Bench Division, Room E 16, Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, London WC 2 A 2 LL. 11.4 Setting aside a statutory demand\n\n11.4.1 The application and witness statement in support of setting aside a statutory demand, exhibiting a copy of the statutory demand, must be filed in Court within 18 days of service of the statutory demand on the debtor. The time limits are different if the statutory demand has been served out of the jurisdiction: see rule 10.1(10).\n\n11.4.2 A debtor who wishes to apply to set aside a statutory demand after the expiration of 18 days, or if service is out of the jurisdiction, after the expiration of the time limit specified by rule 10.1(10)(a) from the date of service of the statutory demand, must apply for an extension of time within which to apply to set aside the statutory demand. The witness statement in support of the application to set aside statutory demand should also contain evidence in support of the application for an extension of time and should state that to the best of the debtor's knowledge and belief the creditor(s) named in the statutory demand has/have not presented a bankruptcy petition.\n\n11.4.3 Unless the Court to which the application to set aside is made operates Electronic Filing and Electronic Practice Direction 51 O applies, the following applies:\n\n(1) Three copies of each document must be lodged with the application, to enable the Court to serve notice of the hearing date on the applicant, the creditor and the person named under rule 10.1(3).\n\n(2) Where copies of the documents are not lodged with the application, any order of the Court fixing a venue is conditional upon copies of the documents being lodged on the next business day after the Court's order, otherwise the application will be deemed to have been dismissed.\n\n11.4.4 Where the debt claimed in the statutory demand is based on a judgment, order, liability order, costs certificate, tax assessment or decision of a tribunal, the Court will not at this stage inquire into the validity of the debt nor, as a general rule, will it adjourn the application to await the result of an application to set aside the judgment, order, decision, costs certificate or any appeal.\n\n11.4.5 The Court will determine an application to set aside a statutory demand in accordance with rule 10.5.\n\n11.4.6 Attention is drawn to the power of the Court to decline to file a petition if there has been a failure to comply with the requirement of rule 10.2. 12. Bankruptcy petitions\n\n12.1 All petitions presented will be listed under the name of the debtor unless the Court directs otherwise. 12.2 Content of petitions\n\n12.2.1 The attention of Court users is drawn to the following points:\n\n(1) A creditor's petition does not require dating, signing or witnessing, but must be verified in accordance with rule 10.10.\n\n(2) In the heading, it is only necessary to recite the debtor's name e.g. Re John William Smith or Re J W Smith (Male). Any alias or trading name will appear in the body of the petition.\n\n12.2.2 Where the petition is based solely on a statutory demand, only the debt claimed in the demand may be included in the petition.\n\n12.2.3 The attention of Court users is also drawn to rules 10.8 and 10.9, where the 'aggregate sum' is made up of a number of debts.\n\n12.2.4 The date of service of the statutory demand should be recited as follows:\n\n(1) Where the demand has been served personally, the date of service as set out in the certificate of service.\n\n(2) Where the demand has been served other than personally, the date as set out in the certificate of service filed in compliance with rule 10.3. 12.3 Searches\n\n12.3.1 The petitioning creditor shall, before presenting a petition, conduct an Official Search with the Chief Land Registrar in the register of pending actions for pending petitions presented against the debtor and shall include the following certificate at the end of the petition:\n\n\"I/we certify that within 7 days ending today, I/we have conducted a search for pending petitions presented against the debtor and that to the best of my/our knowledge, information, and belief [no prior petitions have been presented which are still pending] [a prior petition (No [ ]) has been presented and is/may be pending in the [ Court] and I/we am/are issuing this petition at risk as to costs].Signed…..Dated….\". 12.4 The deposit\n\n12.4.1 A bankruptcy petition will not be treated as having been presented until the Court fee and official receiver's deposit have been paid. A petition filed electronically without payment of the deposit will be marked \"private\" and will not be available for inspection until the deposit has been paid. The date of presentation of the petition will accord with the date on which the deposit has been paid. If the official receiver's deposit is not paid within 7 calendar days after filing the petition, the petition will not be accepted, in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of the Electronic Practice Direction 51 O -The Electronic Working Pilot Scheme.\n\n12.4.2 The deposit will be taken by the Court and forwarded to the official receiver. In the Royal Courts of Justice the petition fee and deposit should be paid by cheque, or by debit or credit card over the phone. In a District Registry or a County Court hearing centre, the petition fee and deposit should be handed to the staff of the duly authorised officer of the Court who will record its receipt. For the purposes of paragraph 12.4.1 above, the deposit will be treated as paid when received by the Court.\n\n12.4.3 If payment is made by cheque, it should be made payable to 'HM Courts and Tribunals Service' or 'HMCTS'. For the purposes of paragraph 12.4 of this IPD, the deposit will be treated as paid when the cheque is received by the Court 12.5 Certificates of continuing debt and of notice of adjournment\n\n12.5.1 At the final hearing of a petition, the Court will need to be satisfied that the debt on which the petition is founded has not been paid or secured or compounded. The Court will normally accept as sufficient evidence a certificate signed by the person representing the petitioning creditor in the following form:\n\n\"I certify that I have/my firm has made enquiries of the petitioning creditor(s) within the last business day prior to the hearing/adjourned hearing and to the best of my knowledge and belief the debt on which the petition is founded is still due and owing and has not been paid or secured or compounded for save as to …Signed ……… Dated ……\"\n\n12.5.2 For convenience, in the Royal Courts of Justice this certificate is incorporated in the attendance sheet for the parties to complete when they come to Court and is to be filed at the hearing. A fresh certificate will be required on each adjourned hearing.\n\n12.5.3 On any adjourned hearing of a petition, in order to satisfy the Court that the petitioner has complied with rule 10.23, the petitioner will be required to file evidence of when (the date), how (the manner), and where (the address), notice of the adjournment order and notification of the venue for the adjourned hearing was sent to:\n\n(1) the debtor, and\n\n(2) any creditor who has given notice under rule 10.19 but was not present at the hearing when the order for adjournment was made or was present at the hearing but the date of the adjourned hearing was not fixed at that hearing.\n\n12.5.4 For convenience, in the Royal Courts of Justice this certificate is incorporated in the attendance sheet for the parties to complete when they come to Court and is to be filed at the hearing. A fresh certificate will be required on each adjourned hearing. It is as follows:\n\n\"I certify that the petitioner has complied with rule 10.23 of the Insolvency Rules 2016 by sending notice of adjournment to the debtor [supporting/opposing creditor(s)] on [date] at [address]\". 12.6 Extension of hearing date of petition\n\n12.6.1 Late applications for extension of hearing dates under rule 10.22, and failure to attend on the listed hearing of a petition, will be dealt with as follows:\n\n(1) If an application is submitted less than two clear working days before the hearing date (for example, later than Monday for Thursday, or Wednesday for Monday), the costs of the application will not be allowed under rule 10.22.\n\n(2) If the petition has not been served and no extension has been granted by the time fixed for the hearing of the petition, and if no one attends for the hearing, the petition may be dismissed or re-listed for hearing about 21 days later. The Court will notify the petitioning creditor's solicitors (or the petitioning creditor in person), and any known supporting or opposing creditors or their solicitors, of the new date and time. A witness statement should then be filed on behalf of the petitioning creditor explaining fully the reasons for the failure to apply for an extension or to appear at the hearing, and (if appropriate) giving reasons why the petition should not be dismissed.\n\n(3) On the re-listed hearing the Court may dismiss the petition if not satisfied it should be adjourned or a further extension granted.\n\n12.6.2 All applications for an extension should include a statement of the date fixed for the hearing of the petition.\n\n12.6.3 The petitioning creditor should contact the Court (by solicitors or in person) on or before the hearing date to ascertain whether the application has reached the file and been dealt with. It should not be assumed that an extension will be granted. 12.7 Service of bankruptcy petitions other than by personal service\n\n12.7.1 Where personal service of the bankruptcy petition is not practicable, service by other means may be permitted. In most cases, evidence that the steps set out in the following paragraphs have been taken will suffice to justify an order for service of a bankruptcy petition other than by personal service:\n\n(1) One personal call at the residence and place of business of the debtor. Where it is known that the debtor has more than one residential or business addresses, personal calls should be made at all the addresses.\n\n(2) Should the creditor fail to effect personal service, a letter should be written to the debtor referring to the call(s), the purpose of the same, and the failure to meet the debtor, adding that a further call will be made for the same purpose on the [day] of [month] 20[ ] at [ ] hours at [place]. Such letter may be sent by first class prepaid post or left at or delivered to the debtor's address in such a way as it is reasonably likely to come to the debtor's attention. At least two business days' notice should be given of the appointment and copies of the letter sent to or left at all known addresses of the debtor. The appointment letter should also state that:\n\n(a) in the event of the time and place not being convenient, the debtor should propose some other time and place reasonably convenient for the purpose;\n\n(b) in the case of a statutory demand as suggested in paragraph 11.2 above, reference is being made to this paragraph for the purpose of service of a statutory demand, the appointment letter should state that if the debtor fails to keep the appointment the creditor proposes to serve the demand by advertisement/ post/ insertion through a letter box as the case may be, and that, in the event of a bankruptcy petition being presented, the Court will be asked to treat such service as service of the demand on the debtor;\n\n(c) (in the case of a petition) if the debtor fails to keep the appointment, an application will be made to the Court for an order that service be effected either by advertisement or in such other manner as the Court may think fit.\n\n(3) when attending any appointment made by letter, inquiry should be made as to whether the debtor is still resident at the address or still frequents the address, and/or other enquiries should be made to ascertain receipt of all letters left for them. If the debtor is away, inquiry should also be made as to when they are returning and whether the letters are being forwarded to an address within the jurisdiction (England and Wales) or elsewhere.\n\n(4) If the debtor is represented by a solicitor, an attempt should be made to arrange an appointment for personal service through such solicitor. The Insolvency Rules permit a solicitor to accept service of a statutory demand on behalf of their client but not the service of a bankruptcy petition. 12.8 Validation orders\n\n12.8.1 A person against whom a bankruptcy petition has been presented may apply to the Court after presentation of the petition for relief from the effects of s.284(1) - (3) of the Act by seeking an order that a certain disposition or dispositions of that person's property, including payments out of their bank account (whether such account is in credit or overdrawn), shall not be void in the event of a bankruptcy order being made at the hearing of the petition (a validation order).\n\n12.8.2 Save in exceptional circumstances, notice of the making of the application should be given to (a) the petitioning creditor(s) or other petitioner, (b) any creditor who has given notice to the petitioner of their intention to appear on the hearing of the petition pursuant to rule 10.19, (c) any creditor who has been substituted as petitioner pursuant to rule 10.27 and (d) any creditor who has carriage of the petition pursuant to rule 10.29.\n\n12.8.3 The application should be supported by a witness statement which, save in exceptional circumstances, should be made by the debtor. If appropriate, supporting evidence in the form of a witness statement from the debtor's accountant should also be produced.\n\n12.8.4 The extent and contents of the evidence will vary according to the circumstances and the nature of the relief sought, but in a case where the debtor is trading or carrying on business it should include, as a minimum, the following information:\n\n(1) when and to whom notice has been given in accordance with paragraph 12.8.2 above;\n\n(2) brief details of the circumstances leading to presentation of the petition;\n\n(3) how the debtor became aware of the presentation of the petition;\n\n(4) whether the petition debt is admitted or disputed and, if the latter, brief details of the basis on which the debt is disputed;\n\n(5) full details of the debtor's financial position including details of their assets (including details of any security and the amount(s) secured) and liabilities, which should be supported, as far as possible, by documentary evidence, e.g. accounts, draft accounts, management accounts or estimated statement of affairs;\n\n(6) a cash flow forecast and profit and loss projection for the period for which the order is sought;\n\n(7) details of the dispositions or payments in respect of which an order is sought;\n\n(8) the reasons relied on in support of the need for such dispositions or payments to be made;\n\n(9) any other information relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion;\n\n(10) details of any consents obtained from the persons mentioned in paragraph 12.8.2 above (supported by documentary evidence where appropriate);\n\n(11) details of any relevant bank account, including its number and the address and sort code of the bank at which such account is held and the amount of the credit or debit balance on such account at the time of making the application.\n\n12.8.5 Where an application is made urgently to enable payments to be made which are essential to continued trading (e.g. wages) and it is not possible to assemble all the evidence listed above, the Court may consider granting limited relief for a short period, but there must be sufficient evidence to satisfy the Court that the interests of creditors are unlikely to be prejudiced.\n\n12.8.6 Where the debtor is not trading or carrying on business and the application relates only to a proposed sale, mortgage or re-mortgage of the debtor's home, evidence of the following will generally suffice:\n\n(1) when and to whom notice has been given in accordance with 12.8.2 above;\n\n(2) whether the petition debt is admitted or disputed and, if the latter, brief details of the basis on which the debt is disputed;\n\n(3) details of the property to be sold, mortgaged or re-mortgaged (including its title number);\n\n(4) the value of the property and the proposed sale price, or details of the mortgage or re-mortgage;\n\n(5) details of any existing mortgages or charges on the property and redemption figures;\n\n(6) the costs of sale (e.g. solicitors' or agents' costs);\n\n(7) how and by whom any net proceeds of sale (or sums coming into the debtor's hands as a result of any mortgage or re-mortgage) are to be held pending the final hearing of the petition;\n\n(8) any other information relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion;\n\n(9) details of any consents obtained from the persons mentioned in 12.8.2 above (supported by documentary evidence where appropriate).\n\n12.8.7 Whether or not the debtor is trading or carrying on business, where the application involves a disposition of property the Court will need to be satisfied that any proposed disposal will be at a proper value. An independent valuation should be obtained for this purpose and exhibited to the evidence.\n\n12.8.8 The Court will need to be satisfied by credible evidence that the debtor is solvent and able to pay their debts as they fall due or that a particular transaction or series of transactions in respect of which the order is sought will be beneficial to or will not prejudice the interests of all the unsecured creditors as a class.\n\n12.8.9 A draft of the order should accompany the application.\n\n12.8.10 Similar considerations to those set out above are likely to apply to applications seeking ratification of a transaction or payment after the making of a bankruptcy order. 13. Applications\n\n13.1 In accordance with rule 12.2(2), in the Royal Courts of Justice an officer acting on behalf of the Operations Manager or chief clerk has been authorised to deal with applications:",

    "content": "Document: Insolvency Proceedings\nPart 3 of 3\n==================================================\n(1) by petitioning creditors to extend the time for hearing petitions (rule 10.22);\n\n(2) by the official receiver:\n\n(a) to transfer proceedings from the High Court to a specified hearing centre within the meaning of rule 12.30.\n\n(b) to amend the title of the proceedings (rule 10.165).\n\n13.2 Outside of the Royal Courts of Justice, applications listed in paragraph 13.1 must be made to a District Judge Sitting in a District Registry or in the County Court to a District Judge.\n\n13.3 Where an application is to be made under 13.1(2)(a) above, the official receiver must comply with rule 12.32, and give any incumbent office-holder 14 days' written notice of the application. 14. Orders without attendance\n\n14.1 In suitable cases the Court will normally be prepared to make orders under Part VIII of the Act (Individual Voluntary Arrangements), without the attendance of the parties, provided there is no bankruptcy order in existence and (so far as is known) no pending petition. The orders are:\n\n(1) A 14 day interim order adjourning the application for 14 days for consideration of the nominee's report, where the papers are in order, and the nominee's signed consent to act includes a waiver of notice of the application or the consent by the nominee to the making of an interim order without attendance.\n\n(2) A standard order on consideration of the nominee's report, extending the interim order to a date seven weeks after the proposed decision date, directing the implementation of the decision procedure and adjourning to a date about three weeks after the decision date. Such an order may be made without attendance if the nominee's report has been delivered to the Court and complies with s.256(1) of the Act, and proposes a decision date not less than 14 days from that on which the nominee's report is filed in Court under rule 8.15, nor more than 28 days from that on which that report is considered by the Court under rule 8.18.\n\n(3) A 'concertina' order, combining orders as under (1) and (2) above. Such an order may be made without attendance if the initial application for an interim order is accompanied by a report of the nominee and the conditions set out in (1) and (2) above are satisfied.\n\n(4) A final order on consideration of the report of the creditors' consideration of the proposal. Such an order may be made without attendance if the report has been filed and complies with rule 8.24. The order will record the effect of the report and may discharge the interim order.\n\n14.2 Provided that the conditions under sub-paragraphs 14.1(2) and 14.1 (4) above are satisfied and that the appropriate report has been lodged with the Court in due time the parties need not attend or be represented on the adjourned hearing for consideration of the nominee's report or of the report of the creditors' giving consideration of the proposal (as the case may be), unless they are notified by the Court that attendance is required. Sealed copies of the order made (in all four cases in paragraph 14.1 above) will be posted by the Court to the applicant or their solicitor and to the nominee.\n\n14.3 In suitable cases the Court may make consent orders without attendance by the parties. The written consent of the parties endorsed on the consent order will be required. Examples of such orders are as follows:\n\n(1) on applications to set aside a statutory demand, orders:\n\n(a) dismissing the application, with or without an order for costs as may be agreed (permission will be given to present a petition on or after the seventh day after the date of the order, unless a different date is agreed);\n\n(b) setting aside the demand, with or without an order for costs as may be agreed.\n\n(2) On petitions where there are no supporting or opposing creditors (see rule 10.19), and there is a statement signed by or on behalf of the petitioning creditor confirming that no notices have been received from supporting or opposing creditors, orders:\n\n(a) dismissing the petition, with or without an order for costs as may be agreed; or\n\n(b) if the petition has not been served, giving permission to withdraw the petition (with no order for costs).\n\n(3) On other applications or orders:\n\n(a) for sale of property, possession of property, disposal of proceeds of sale;\n\n(b) giving interim directions;\n\n(c) dismissing the application, with or without an order for costs as may be agreed;\n\n(d) giving permission to withdraw the application, with or without an order for costs as may be agreed.\n\n14.4 If, as may often be the case with orders under sub-paragraphs 3(a) or (b) above, an adjournment is required, whether generally with liberty to restore or to a fixed date, the order by consent may include an order for the adjournment. If adjournment to a date is requested, a time estimate should be given and the Court will fix the first available date and time on or after the date requested.\n\n14.5 The above lists should not be regarded as exhaustive, nor should it be assumed that an order will be made without attendance as requested.\n\n14.6 Applications for consent orders without attendance should be lodged at least two clear working days (and preferably longer) before any hearing date.\n\n14.7 Whenever a document is lodged or a letter sent, the correct case number should be quoted. A note should also be given of the date and time of the next hearing (if any). 15. Bankruptcy restrictions undertakings\n\n15.1 Where a bankrupt has given a bankruptcy restrictions undertaking, the Secretary of State or official receiver must file a copy in Court and send a copy to the bankrupt as soon as reasonably practicable (rule 11.11). In addition the Secretary of State must notify the Court immediately that the bankrupt has given such an undertaking in order that any hearing date can be vacated. 16. Persons at risk of violence\n\n16.1 Where an application is made pursuant to rules 8.6, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6 or otherwise to limit disclosure of information as to a person's current address by reason of the possibility of violence, the relevant application should be accompanied by a witness statement which includes the following:\n\n(1) The grounds upon which it is contended that disclosure of the current address as defined by rule 20.1 might reasonably be expected to lead to violence against the debtor or a person who normally resides with them as a member of their family or where appropriate any other person.\n\n(2) Where the application is made in respect of the address of the debtor, the debtor's proposals with regard to information which may safely be given to potential creditors in order that they can recognise that the debtor is a person who may be indebted to them, in particular the address at which the debtor previously resided or carried on business and the nature of such business.\n\n(3) The terms of the order sought by the applicant by reference to the Court's particular powers as set out in the rule under which the application is made and, unless impracticable, a draft of the order sought.\n\n(4) Where the application is made by the debtor in respect of whom a nominee or supervisor has been appointed or against whom a bankruptcy order has been made, evidence of the consent of the nominee/supervisor, or, in the case of bankruptcy, the official receiver or any other person appointed as trustee in bankruptcy. Where such consent is not available the statement must indicate whether such consent has been refused.\n\n16.2. Any person listed in 16.1(4) shall be made a respondent to the application.\n\n16.3 The application shall be referred to a District Judge Sitting in a District Registry, ICC Judge, or High Court Judge where it will be considered without a hearing in the first instance but without prejudice to the right of the Court to list it for hearing if:\n\n(1) the Court is not persuaded by the written evidence, and consequently may refuse the application;\n\n(2) the consent of any respondent is not attached; or\n\n(3) the Court is of the view that there is another reason why listing is appropriate.

Applicants must, before making the application, check for any amendments to the Regulations. PART SIX: APPLICATIONS RELATING TO THE REMUNERATION OF OFFICE-HOLDERS\n\n21. This IPD sets out the governing principles and court practice. Reference should also be made to the Act and the Insolvency Rules.\n\n21.1 The objective in any remuneration application is to ensure that the amount and/or basis of any remuneration fixed by the Court is fair, reasonable and commensurate with the nature and extent of the work properly undertaken or to be undertaken by the office-holder in any given case and is fixed and approved by a process which is consistent and predictable.\n\n21.2. The guiding principles which follow are intended to assist in achieving the objective:\n\n(1) \"Justification\". It is for the office-holder who seeks to be remunerated at a particular level and / or in a particular manner to justify their claim. They are responsible for preparing and providing full particulars of the basis for, and the nature of, their claim for remuneration.\n\n(2) \"The benefit of the doubt\". The corollary of the \"justification\" principle is that if after having regard to the evidence and guiding principles there remains any doubt as to the appropriateness, fairness or reasonableness of the remuneration sought or to be fixed (whether arising from a lack of particularity as to the basis for and the nature of the office-holder's claim to remuneration or otherwise), such element of doubt should be resolved by the Court against the office-holder.\n\n(3) \"Professional integrity\". The Court should (where this is the case) give weight to the fact that the office-holder is a member of a regulated profession and as such is subject to rules and guidance as to professional conduct and the fact that (where this is the case) the office-holder is an officer of the Court.\n\n(4) \"The value of the service rendered\". The remuneration of an office-holder should reflect the value of the service rendered by the office-holder, not simply reimburse the office-holder in respect of time expended and cost incurred.\n\n(5) \"Fair and reasonable\". The amount and basis of the office-holder's remuneration should represent fair and reasonable remuneration for the work properly undertaken or to be undertaken.\n\n(6) \"Proportionality of information\". In considering the nature and extent of the information which should be provided by an office-holder in respect of a remuneration application to the Court, the office-holder and any other parties to the application shall have regard to what is proportionate by reference to the amount of remuneration to be fixed, the nature, complexity and extent of the work to be completed (where the application relates to future remuneration) or that has been completed by the office-holder and the value and nature of the assets and liabilities with which the office-holder will have to deal or has had to deal.\n\n(7) \"Proportionality of remuneration\". The amount and basis of remuneration to be fixed by the Court should be proportionate to the nature, complexity and extent of the work to be completed (where the application relates to future remuneration) or that has been completed by the office-holder and the value and nature of the assets and/or potential assets and the liabilities and/or potential liabilities with which the office-holder will have to deal or has had to deal, the nature and degree of the responsibility to which the office-holder has been subject in any given case, the nature and extent of the risk (if any) assumed by the office-holder and the efficiency (in respect of both time and cost) with which the office-holder has completed the work undertaken.\n\n(8) \"Professional guidance\". In respect of an application for the fixing and approval of the amount and/or basis of the remuneration, the office-holder may have regard to the relevant and current statements of practice promulgated by any relevant regulatory and professional bodies in relation to the fixing of the remuneration of an office-holder. In considering a remuneration application, the Court may also have regard to such statements of practice and the extent of compliance with such statements of practice by the office-holder.\n\n(9) \"Timing of application\". The Court will take into account whether any application should have been made earlier and if so the reasons for any delay.\n\n21.3 Hearing of a remuneration application. The general rule applies for the listing of hearings as set out in paragraph 3 of this IPD. The judge hearing the application may summarily determine the application or adjourn with directions including (but not confined to) directions as to (i) whether an assessor or costs judge should prepare a report to the Court in respect of the remuneration (ii) or whether the application should be heard by a judge and an assessor or a costs judge.\n\n21.4.On any remuneration application, the office-holder should provide the information and evidence referred to in paragraphs 21.4.1 to 21.4.12 below.\n\n21.4.1 A narrative description and explanation of:\n\n(a) the background to, the relevant circumstances of, and the reasons for their appointment;\n\n(b) the work undertaken or to be undertaken in respect of the appointment; the description should be divided, insofar as possible, into individual tasks or categories of task (general descriptions of work, tasks, or categories of task should (insofar as possible) be avoided);\n\n(c) the reasons why it is or was considered reasonable and/or necessary and/or beneficial for such work to be done, giving details of why particular tasks or categories of task were undertaken and why such tasks or categories of task are to be undertaken or have been undertaken by particular individuals and in a particular manner;\n\n(d) the amount of time to be spent or that has been spent in respect of work to be completed or that has been completed and why it is considered to be fair, reasonable and proportionate;\n\n(e) what is likely to be and has been achieved, the benefits that are likely to and have accrued as a consequence of the work that is to be or has been completed, the manner in which the work required in respect of the appointment is progressing and what, in the opinion of the office-holder, remains to be achieved.\n\n21.4.2 Details sufficient for the Court to determine the application by reference to the criteria which are required to be taken into account by reference to the Insolvency Rules and any other applicable enactments or rules relevant to the fixing of the remuneration.\n\n21.4.3 A statement of the total number of hours of work undertaken or to be undertaken in respect of which the remuneration is sought, together with a breakdown of such hours by individual member of staff and individual tasks or categories of tasks to be performed or that have been performed. Where appropriate, a proportionate level of detail should also be given of:\n\n(a) the tasks or categories of tasks to be undertaken as a proportion of the total amount of work to be undertaken in respect of which the remuneration is sought and the tasks or categories of tasks that have been undertaken as a proportion of the total amount of work that has been undertaken in respect of which the remuneration is sought; and\n\n(b) the tasks or categories of task to be completed by individual members of staff or grade of personnel including the office-holder as a proportion of the total amount of work to be completed by all members of staff including the office-holder in respect of which the remuneration is sought and the tasks or categories of task that have been completed by individual members of staff or grade of personnel as a proportion of the total amount of work that has been completed by all members of staff including the office-holder in respect of which the remuneration is sought.\n\n21.4.4 A statement of the total amount to be or likely to be charged for the work to be undertaken or that has been undertaken in respect of which the remuneration is sought which should include:\n\n(a) a breakdown of such amounts by individual member of staff and individual task or categories of task performed or to be performed;\n\n(b) details of the time expended or to be expended and the remuneration charged or to be charged in respect of each individual task or category of task as a proportion (respectively) of the total time expended or to be expended and the total remuneration charged or to be charged.\n\nIn respect of an application pursuant to which some or all of the amount of the office-holder's remuneration is to be fixed on a basis other than time properly spent, the office-holder shall provide (for the purposes of comparison) the same details as are required by this paragraph 19.4.4, but on the basis of what would have been charged had they been seeking remuneration on the basis of the time properly spent by the office-holder and their staff.\n\n21.4.5 Details of each individual to be engaged or who has been engaged in work in respect of the appointment and in respect of which the remuneration is sought, including details of their relevant experience, training, qualifications and the level of their seniority.\n\n21.4.6 An explanation of:\n\n(a) the steps, if any, to be taken or that have been taken by the office-holder to avoid duplication of effort and cost in respect of the work to be completed or that has been completed in respect of which the remuneration is sought;\n\n(b) the steps to be taken or that have been taken to ensure that the work to be completed or that has been completed is to be or was undertaken by individuals of appropriate experience and seniority relative to the nature of the work to be or that has been undertaken.\n\n21.4.7 Details of the individual rates charged by the office-holder and members of their staff in respect of the work to be completed or that has been completed and in respect of which the remuneration is sought. Such details should include:\n\n(a) a general explanation of the policy adopted in relation to the fixing or calculation of such rates and the recording of time spent;\n\n(b) where, exceptionally, the office-holder seeks remuneration in respect of time spent by secretaries, cashiers or other administrative staff whose work would otherwise be regarded as an overhead cost forming a component part of the rates charged by the office-holder and members of their staff, a detailed explanation as to why such costs should be allowed or should be provided.\n\n21.4.8 Where the remuneration application is in respect of a period of time during which the charge-out rates of the office-holder and/or members of their staff engaged in work in respect of the appointment have increased, an explanation of the nature, extent and reason for such increase and the date when such increase took effect.\n\n21.4.9 Details of any basis or amount of remuneration previously fixed or approved in relation to the appointment (whether by the Court or otherwise) including in particular the bases or amounts that were previously sought to be fixed or approved and the bases or amounts that were in fact fixed or approved and the method by which such amounts were fixed or approved.\n\n21.4.10 Where the application is for approval to draw remuneration in excess of the total amount set out in the fees estimate, their evidence must exhibit a copy of the fees estimate and address the matters listed in rule 18.30(3).\n\n21.4.11 In order that the Court may be able to consider the views of any persons who the office-holder considers have an interest in the assets that are under their control and of any other persons who are required by the Insolvency Rules to be notified of the hearing of the application, the office-holder must provide details of:\n\n(a) the names and contact details for all such persons;\n\n(b)what (if any) consultation has taken place between the office-holder and those persons and if no such consultation has taken place, an explanation as to the reason why;\n\n(c) the number and value of the interests of the persons consulted including details of the proportion (by number and by value) of the interests of such persons by reference to the entirety of those persons having an interest in the assets under the control of the office-holder.\n\n21.4.12 Such other relevant information as the office-holder considers, in the circumstances, ought to be provided to the Court.\n\n21.5 This paragraph applies to applications where some or all of the remuneration of the office-holder is to be fixed and/or approved on a basis other than time properly spent. On such applications in addition to the matters referred to in paragraph 21.4, the office-holder shall:\n\n(a) Provide a full description of the reasons for remuneration being sought by reference to the basis contended for.\n\n(b) Where the remuneration is sought to be fixed by reference to a percentage of the value of the property with which the office-holder has to deal or of the assets which are realised or distributed, provide a full explanation of the basis upon which any percentage rates to be applied to the values of such property or the assets realised and/or distributed have been chosen.\n\n(c) Provide a statement that to the best of the office-holder's belief the percentage rates or other bases by reference to which some or all of the remuneration is to be fixed are similar to the percentage rates or other bases that are applied or have been applied in respect of other appointments of a similar nature.\n\n(d) Provide a comparison of the amount to be charged by reference to the basis contended for and the amount that would otherwise have been charged by reference to the other available bases of remuneration, including by reference to rule 18.22 and Schedule 11 to the Insolvency Rules (scale of fees).\n\n21.6 The witness evidence may exclude matters set out in paragraph 21.4 above but an explanation as to why a decision to exclude such material should be included in the witness evidence.\n\n21.7 The evidence placed before the Court by the office-holder in respect of any remuneration application should also include the following documents:\n\n(a) a copy of the most recent receipts and payments account;\n\n(b) copies of any reports by the office-holder to the persons having an interest in the assets under their control relevant to the period for which the remuneration sought to be fixed and approved relates;\n\n(c) any fees estimate, details of anticipated expenses or other relevant information given or required to be given to the creditors in relation to remuneration by the office-holder pursuant to the Insolvency Rules;\n\n(d) any other schedules or such other documents providing the information referred to in paragraphs 21.4 above, where these are likely to be of assistance to the Court in considering the application;\n\n(e) evidence of any consultation or copies of any relevant communications with those persons having an interest in the assets under the control of office-holder in relation to the remuneration of the office-holder.\n\n21.8 On any remuneration application the Court may make an order allowing payments of remuneration to be made on account subject to final approval whether by the Court or otherwise.\n\n21.9 Unless otherwise ordered by the Court (or as may otherwise be provided for in any enactment or rules of procedure), the costs of and occasioned by an application for the fixing and/or approval of the remuneration of an office-holder, including those of any assessor, shall be paid out of the assets under the control of the office-holder. PART SEVEN: UNFAIR PREJUDICE PETITIONS, WINDING UP AND VALIDATION ORDERS 22 Unfair Prejudice Petitions\n\n22.1 Attention is drawn to the undesirability of asking as a matter of course for a winding up order as an alternative to an order under s.994 of the 2006 Act. The petition should not ask for a winding up order unless that is the remedy which the petitioner prefers, or it is thought that it may be the only remedy to which the petitioner is entitled.\n\n22.2. Whenever a winding up order is asked for in a contributory's petition, the petition must state whether the petitioner consents or objects to a validation order under s.127 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in the standard form. If the petitioner objects, the written evidence in support must contain a short statement of the petitioner's reasons.\n\n22.3.If the petitioner objects to a validation order in the standard form but consents to such an order in a modified form, the petition must set out the form of order to which the petitioner consents, and the written evidence in support must contain a short statement of the petitioner's reasons for seeking the modification.\n\n22.4.If the petition contains a statement that the petitioner consents to a validation order, whether in the standard or a modified form, but the petitioner changes their mind before the first hearing of the petition, the petitioner must notify the respondents and may apply on notice to the court for an order directing that no validation order or a modified order only (as the case may be) shall be made by the Court, but validating dispositions made without notice of the order made by the Court.\n\n22.5.If the petition contains a statement that the petitioner consents to validation order, whether in the standard or a modified form, the Court shall without further enquiry make such an order at the first hearing unless an order to the contrary has been made by the Court in the meantime.\n\n22.6.If the petition contains a statement that the petitioner objects to a validation order in the standard form, the company may apply (in the case of urgency, without notice) to the Court for an order.",

    "content": "PRACTICE DIRECTION RELATING TO THE USE OF THE WELSH LANGUAGE IN CASES IN THE CIVIL COURTS IN OR HAVING A CONNECTION WITH WALES\n\n---\n\nThe purpose of this Practice Direction is to reflect the principles of the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 that in the administration of justice in Wales, the English and Welsh languages should be treated on the basis of equality.\n\n---\n\n1. GENERAL\n\n1.1 This practice direction applies to civil proceedings in or having a connection with Wales.\n\n1.2 The existing practice of conducting a hearing in Wales entirely in the Welsh language on an ad hoc basis and without notice will continue to apply when all parties and witnesses directly involved at the time consent to the proceedings being so conducted.\n\n1.3 In every case in Wales in which it is possible that the Welsh language may be used by any party or witness [or in any document which may be placed before the court], the parties or their legal representatives must inform the court of that fact so that appropriate arrangements can be made for the management and listing of the case.\n\n1.4 Any document placed before the court in civil proceedings in or having a connection with Wales may be in the English or Welsh Language. The parties or their legal representatives must inform the court as soon as practicable if a document in the Welsh language will or may be placed before the court so that appropriate arrangements can be made.\n\n1.5 HMCTS forms in the Welsh language are available on the justice.gov.uk website. The Welsh Language Unit of HMCTS provides translation facilities.\n\n1.6 If costs are incurred as a result of a party failing to comply with this direction, a costs Order may be made against that party or their legal representative.\n\n1.7 Where a case is tried with a jury, the law does not permit the selection of jurors in a manner which enables the court to discover whether a juror does or does not speak Welsh or to secure a jury whose members are bilingual to try a case in which the Welsh language may be used.\n\n---\n\n2. THE ALLOCATION QUESTIONNAIRE\n\n2.1 In any proceedings in which a party is required to complete a directions questionnaire, that party must include details relating to the possible use of Welsh (i.e. details of any person wishing to give oral evidence in Welsh and of any documents in Welsh (e.g. documents to be disclosed under Part 31 or witness statements) which that party expects to use).\n\n2.2 A party must include the details mentioned in paragraph 2.1 in the directions questionnaire even if that party has already informed the court of the possible use of Welsh in accordance with the provisions of section 1 above.\n\n---\n\n3. CASE MANAGEMENT\n\n3.1 At any interlocutory hearing, the court will take the opportunity to consider whether it should give case management directions. To assist the court, a party or that party's legal representative should draw the court's attention to the possibility of Welsh being used in the proceedings, even where he or she has already done so in compliance with other provisions of this direction.\n\n3.2 In any case where a party is required to complete a pre-trial check list (listing questionnaire) and has already intimated the intention to use Welsh, that party should confirm the intended use of Welsh in the pre-trial check list and provide any details which have not been set out in the allocation questionnaire.\n\n---\n\n4. LISTING BY THE COURT\n\n4.1 The diary manager, in consultation with the Designated Civil Judge and the Liaison Judge(s) for the Welsh language, will ensure that a case in which the Welsh language is to be used is listed-\n\n(a) wherever practicable before a Welsh speaking judge; and\n\n(b) where translation facilities are needed, at a court with simultaneous translation facilities.\n\n---\n\n5. INTERPRETERS\n\n5.1 Whenever an interpreter is needed to translate evidence from English to Welsh or from Welsh to English, the Court Manager in whose court the case is to be heard will take steps to secure the attendance of an interpreter whose name is included in the list of approved court interpreters.\n\n---\n\n6. WITNESSES AND JURORS\n\n6.1 When each witness is called, the court officer administering the oath or affirmation will inform the witness that he or she may be sworn or may affirm in Welsh or English as he or she wishes.\n\n6.2 Where a case is tried with a jury, the court officer swearing in the jury will inform the jurors in open court that each juror may take the oath or may affirm in Welsh or English as he or she wishes.\n\n---\n\n7. ROLE OF THE LIAISON JUDGE\n\n---\n\n7.1\n\nIf any question or difficulty arises concerning the implementation of this practice direction, contact should in the first place be made with the Liaison Judge(s) for the Welsh language.\n\n---\n\nCYFARWYDDYD YMARFER SY'N YMWNEUD Â DEFNYDDIO'R IAITH GYMRAEG MEWN ACHOSION YN Y LLYSOEDD SIFIL YNG NGHYMRU NEU SY'N GYSYLLTIEDIG Â CHYMRU\n\nDiben y Cyfarwyddyd Ymarfer hwn yw adlewyrchu egwyddorion Deddf yr Iaith Gymraeg 1993 a Mesur yr Iaith Gymraeg (Cymru) 2011 sef y dylid trin y Gymraeg a'r Saesneg yn gyfartal wrth weinyddu cyfiawnder yng Nghymru.\n\n---\n\n1.

    "content": "Document: Devolution Issues and Crown Office Applications in Wales (English)\nSection: DI 1\nPart 1 of 4\n==================================================\nPRACTICE DIRECTION - DEVOLUTION ISSUES\n\nPRACTICE DIRECTION DEVOLUTION ISSUES\n\nContents of this Practice Direction\n\nPART I INTRODUCTION Definitions\n\n1 In this Practice Direction -\n\n'the Assembly' means the National Assembly for Wales or Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru\n\n'the GWA' means the Government of Wales Act 1998\n\n'the NIA' means the Northern Ireland Act 1998\n\n'the SA' means the Scotland Act 1998\n\n'the Acts' mean the GWA, the NIA and the SA\n\n'the Judicial Committee' means the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council\n\n'the CPR' means the Civil Procedure Rules 1998\n\n'the FPR' means the Family Proceedings Rules 1991\n\n'the FPC' means the Family Proceedings Courts (Children Act 1989) Rules 1991\n\n'devolution issue' has the same meaning as in paragraph 1, schedule 8 to the GWA; paragraph 1, schedule 10 to the NIA; and paragraph 1, schedule 6 of the SA\n\n'devolution issue notice' means a notice that a devolution issue has arisen in proceedings Scope\n\n2.1 This Practice Direction supplements the provisions dealing with devolution issues in the Acts. It deals specifically with the position if a devolution issue arises under the GWA. If a devolution issue arises under the NIA or the SA the procedure laid down in this Practice Direction should be adapted as required. The devolution legislation\n\n3.1 Schedule 8 to the GWA contains provisions dealing with devolution issues arising out of the GWA; schedule 10 to the NIA contains provisions dealing with devolution issues arising out of the NIA; and schedule 6 to the SA contains provisions dealing with devolution issues arising out of the SA.\n\n3.2 Broadly a devolution issue will involve a question whether a devolved body has acted or proposes to act within its powers (which includes not acting incompatibly with Convention rights 1 and Community law 2) or has failed to comply with a duty imposed on it. Reference should be made to the Acts where 'devolution issue' is defined.\n\n3.3\n\n(1) If a devolution issue under the GWA arises in proceedings, the court must order notice of it to be given to the Attorney General and the Assembly if they are not already a party. They have a right to take part as a party in the proceedings so far as they relate to a devolution issue, if they are not already a party (paragraph 5, schedule 8 to the GWA.) If they do take part, they may require the court to refer the devolution issue to the Judicial Committee (paragraph 30, schedule 8 to the GWA)3.\n\n(2) There are similar provisions in the NIA and the SA although the persons to be notified are different (paragraphs 13, 14, and 33, schedule 10 to the NIA; paragraphs 16, 17 and 33, schedule 6 to the SA).\n\n3.4 Under all the Acts the court may refer a devolution issue to another court as follows:\n\n(1) A magistrates' court may refer a devolution issue arising in civil or summary proceedings to the High Court (paragraphs 6 and 9, schedule 8 to the GWA; paragraphs 15 and 18, schedule 10 to the NIA; and paragraphs 18 and 21, schedule 6 to the SA).\n\n(2) The Crown Court may refer a devolution issue arising in summary proceedings to the High Court and a devolution issue arising in proceedings on indictment to the Court of Appeal (paragraph 9, schedule 8 to the GWA; paragraph 18, schedule 10 to the NIA; paragraph 21, schedule 6 to the SA).\n\n(3) The County Court, the High Court (unless the devolution issue has been referred to the High Court)4, and the Crown Court 5 may refer a devolution issue arising in civil proceedings to the Court of Appeal (paragraph 7, schedule 8 to the GWA; paragraph 16, schedule 10 to the NIA; paragraph 19, schedule 6 to the SA).\n\n(4) A tribunal from which there is no appeal must, and any other tribunal may, refer a devolution issue to the Court of Appeal (paragraph 8, schedule 8 to the GWA; paragraph 17, schedule 10 to the NIA; paragraph 20, schedule 6 to the SA).\n\n(5) The Court of Appeal may refer a devolution issue to the Judicial Committee, unless the devolution issue was referred to it by another court (paragraph 10, schedule 8 to the GWA; paragraph 19, schedule 10 to the NIA; paragraph 22, schedule 6 to the SA).\n\n(6) An appeal against the determination of a devolution issue by the High Court or the Court of Appeal on a reference lies to the Judicial Committee with the leave of the court concerned, or, failing such leave, with special leave of the Judicial Committee (paragraph 11, schedule 8 to the GWA; paragraph 20, schedule 10 to the NIA; paragraph 23, schedule 6 to the SA).\n\n3.5 A court may take into account additional expense which the court considers that a party has incurred as a result of the participation of the Attorney General or the Assembly in deciding any question as to costs (paragraph 35, schedule 8 to the GWA). PART II DIRECTIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL PROCEEDINGS\n\nScope\n\n4 Paragraphs 5 to 13 apply to proceedings in England and Wales in the magistrates' courts, the County Court, the Crown Court, the High Court and the Court of Appeal (Civil and Criminal Division). Paragraph 10 also applies to the form and procedure for a reference to the Court of Appeal by a tribunal. Raising the question as to whether a devolution issue arises\n\n5.1 Where a party to any form of proceedings wishes to raise an issue which may be a devolution issue whether as a claim (or part of a claim) to enforce or establish a legal right or to seek a remedy or as a defence (or part of a defence), the provisions of this Practice Direction apply in addition to the rules of procedure applicable to the proceedings in which the issue arises.\n\n5.2 A court may, of its own volition, require the question of whether a devolution issue arises to be considered, if the materials put before the court indicate such an issue may arise, even if the parties have not used the term 'devolution issue'. Determination by a court of whether a devolution issue arises\n\n6.1 The court may give such directions as it considers appropriate to obtain clarification or additional information to establish whether a devolution issue arises.\n\n6.2 In determining whether a devolution issue arises the court, notwithstanding the contention of a party to the proceedings, may decide that a devolution issue shall not be taken to arise if the contention appears to the court to be frivolous or vexatious (paragraph 2 of schedule 8 to the GWA).\n\n6.3 If the court determines that a devolution issue arises it must state what that devolution issue is clearly and concisely. Notice of devolution issue to the Attorney General and the Assembly\n\n7.1 If a court determines that a devolution issue arises in the proceedings, it must order a devolution issue notice substantially in the form numbered 'DI 1' in Annex 1 to be given to the Attorney General and the Assembly unless they are already a party to the proceedings (paragraph 5(1), schedule 8 to the GWA).\n\n7.2 A court receiving a reference does not have to serve a devolution issue notice unless it determines that a devolution issue that was not identified by the court making the reference has arisen. In that case the court receiving the reference must serve a devolution issue notice which must:\n\n(1) state what devolution issue has been referred to it;\n\n(2) state what further devolution issue has arisen; and\n\n(3) identify the referring court.\n\n7.3 If the devolution issue has arisen in criminal proceedings, the devolution issue notice must state:\n\n(1) whether the proceedings have been adjourned;\n\n(2) whether the defendant is remanded in custody; and\n\n(3) if the defendant has been remanded in custody and his trial has not commenced, when the custody time limit expires 6.\n\n7.4 If the devolution issue arises in an appeal, the devolution issue notice must:\n\n(1) state that the devolution issue arises in an appeal;\n\n(2) identify the court whose decision is being appealed; and\n\n(3) state whether the devolution issue is raised for the first time on appeal; or, if it is not, state that the devolution issue was raised in the court whose decision is being appealed, what decision was reached by that court, and the date of the previous notice to the Attorney General and the Assembly.\n\n7.5 The devolution issue notice will specify a date as the date by which the Attorney General or the Assembly must notify the court of any intention to take part as a party to the proceedings, so far as they relate to a devolution issues. Such date will be 14 days, or such longer period as the court may direct (see below), after the date of the notice.\n\n7.6 The court may, in exceptional circumstances, specify a date longer than 14 days after the date of the notice as the date by which the Attorney General and the Assembly must notify the court of any intention to take part as a party to the proceedings. The court may do this before the notice is given, or before or after the expiry of the period given in the notice.\n\n7.7\n\n(1) On the date of the devolution issue notice -\n\n(a) the notice for the Attorney General must be faxed to the Attorney General's Office by the court 7; and\n\n(b) the notice for the Assembly must be faxed by the court to the Counsel General for the Assembly.\n\n(2) On the same day as a fax is sent a copy of the devolution issue notice must be sent by the court by first class post to the Attorney General and the Counsel General for the Assembly.\n\n7.8 The court may, on such terms as it considers appropriate, order such additional documents to be served (e.g. in civil proceedings, the claim form) or additional information to be supplied with the devolution issue notice.\n\n7.9\n\n(1) When a court orders a devolution issue notice to be given the court may make such further orders as it thinks fit in relation to any adjournment, stay, continuance of the proceedings, or interim measures, during the period within which the Attorney General and the Assembly have to notify the court if they intend to take part as a party to the proceedings.\n\n(2) Before ordering an adjournment in criminal proceedings, the court will consider all material circumstances, including whether it would involve delay that might extend beyond the custody time limits if the defendant is remanded in custody and his trial has not commenced.\n\n7.10 If neither the Attorney General nor the Assembly notify the court within the specified time of any intention to take part as a party to the proceedings:\n\n(1) the proceedings should immediately continue on expiry of the period within which they had to notify the court; and\n\n(2) the court has no duty to inform them of the outcome of the proceedings apart from the duty to notify them if the court decides to refer the devolution issue to another court (see paragraph 10.3(5)).8 Adding the Attorney General or the Assembly to the proceedings and their right to require referral of a devolution issue to the Judicial Committee\n\n8.1 If the Attorney General or the Assembly intends to take part as a party to the proceedings so far as they relate to a devolution issue, the Attorney General or the Assembly must send to the court and the other parties (and to each other if only one of them has become a party) a notice substantially in the form numbered 'DI 2' shown in Annex 1 within the time specified in the devolution issue notice.\n\n8.2 On receipt of this form the court may give such consequential directions as it considers necessary.\n\n8.3 If the Attorney General or the Assembly is a party to the proceedings, and either of them intends to require the court to refer the devolution issue to the Judicial Committee, the Attorney General or the Assembly must as soon as practicable send to the court and the other parties (and to each other if only one of them has become a party) a notice substantially in the form numbered 'DI 3' shown in Annex 1. Determination by the court of whether or not to make a reference of a devolution issue if the Attorney General or the Assembly do not require a reference\n\n9.1 If the court is not required to refer the devolution issue to the Judicial Committee, the court will decide whether it should refer the devolution issue to the relevant court as specified in paragraph 3.4.\n\n9.2 Before deciding whether to make a reference the court may hold a directions hearing or give written directions as to the making of submissions on the question of whether to make a reference.\n\n9.3 The court may make a decision on the basis of written submissions if its procedures permit this and it wishes to do so, or the court may have a hearing before making a decision.\n\n9.4 In exercising its discretion as to whether to make a reference, the court will have regard to all relevant circumstances and in particular to:\n\n(1) the importance of the devolution issue to the public in general;\n\n(2) the importance of the devolution issue to the original parties to the proceedings;\n\n(3) whether a decision on the reference of the devolution issue will be decisive of the matters in dispute between the parties;\n\n(4) whether all the relevant findings of fact have been made (a devolution issue will not, unless there are exceptional circumstances, be suitable for a reference if it has to be referred on the basis of assumed facts);\n\n(5) the delay that a reference would entail particularly in cases involving children and criminal cases (including whether the reference is likely to involve delay that would extend beyond the expiry of the custody time limits if the defendant is remanded in custody and his trial has not commenced); and\n\n(6) additional costs that a reference might involve 9.\n\n9.5 The court should state its reasons for making or declining to make a reference.\n\n9.6 If the court decides not to refer the case, it will give directions for the future conduct of the action, which will include directions as to the participation of the Attorney General and the Assembly if they are parties. Form and procedure for references\n\n10.1 If the court or tribunal is required by the Attorney General or the Assembly (in relation to any proceedings before the court to which he or it is a party) to refer the devolution issue to the Judicial Committee:\n\n(1) the court or tribunal will make the reference as soon as practicable after receiving the notice from the Attorney General or the Assembly substantially in the form numbered 'DI 3' shown in Annex 1, and follow the procedure for references in the Judicial Committee (Devolution Issues) Rules Order 1999; and\n\n(2) the court or tribunal may order the parties, or any of them, to draft the reference.\n\n10.2 If the Court of Appeal decides to refer the devolution issue to the Judicial Committee:\n\n(1) it will follow the procedure in the Judicial Committee (Devolution Issues) Rules Order 1999; and\n\n(2) the court may order the parties, or any of them, to draft the reference.\n\n10.3 If any other court or tribunal decides, or if a tribunal is required, to refer the devolution issue to another court:\n\n(1) the reference must be substantially in the form numbered 'DI 4' shown in Annex 1 and must set out the following:\n\n(a) the question referred;\n\n(b) the addresses of the parties, except in the case of family proceedings, for which see paragraphs 15.2-4;\n\n(c) a concise statement of the background of the matter including -\n\n(i) the facts of the case, including any relevant findings of fact by the referring court or lower courts; and\n\n(ii) the main issues in the case and the contentions of the parties with regard to them;\n\n(d) the relevant law, including the relevant provisions of the GWA;\n\n(e) the reasons why an answer to the question is considered necessary for the purpose of disposing of the proceedings;\n\n(2) all judgments already given in the proceedings will be annexed to the reference;\n\n(3) the court may order the parties, or any of them, to draft the reference;\n\n(4) the court or tribunal will transmit the reference to:\n\n(a) the Civil Appeals Office Registry if the reference is to the Court of Appeal from the County Court, the High Court or the Crown Court in civil proceedings, or from a tribunal;\n\n(b) the Registrar of Criminal Appeals if the reference is to the Court of Appeal from the Crown Court in proceedings on indictment; and\n\n(c) the Administrative Court Office if the reference is to the High Court from a magistrates' court in civil or summary proceedings or from the Crown Court in summary proceedings 10.\n\nIf the reference is transmitted to Cardiff an additional copy of the reference must be filed so that it can be retained by the Cardiff Office. The original reference will be forwarded to the Administrative Court Office in London.\n\n(5) at the same time as the reference is transmitted to the court receiving the reference a copy of the reference will be sent by first class post to:\n\n(a) the parties;\n\n(b) the Attorney General if not already a party; and\n\n(c) the Assembly if it is not already a party;\n\n(6) each person on whom a copy of the reference is served must within 21 days notify the court to which the reference is transmitted and the other persons on whom the reference is served whether they wish to be heard on the reference;\n\n(7) the court receiving the reference (either the Court of Appeal or the High Court) will give directions for the conduct of the reference, including the lodging of cases or skeleton arguments; and transmit a copy of the determination on the reference to the referring court; and\n\n(8) if there has been an appeal to the Judicial Committee against a decision of the High Court or the Court of Appeal on a reference, and a copy of the Judicial Committee's decision on that appeal has been sent to the High Court or Court of Appeal (as the case may be), that court will send a copy to the court which referred the devolution issue to it.\n\n10.4 When a court receives notification of the decision on a reference, it will determine how to proceed with the remainder of the case. Power of the court to deal with pending proceedings if a reference is made (whether by the Attorney General, the Assembly or the court)\n\n11 If a reference is made the court will adjourn or stay the proceedings in which the devolution issue arose, unless it otherwise orders; and will make such further orders as it thinks fit in relation to any adjournment or stay. The Welsh language\n\n12.1 If any party wishes to put forward a contention in relation to a devolution issue that involves comparison of the Welsh and English texts of any Assembly subordinate legislation, that party must give notice to the court as soon as possible.\n\n12.2 Upon receipt of the notification, the court will consider the appropriate means of determining the issue, including, if necessary, the appointment of a Welsh speaking judicial assessor to assist the court.\n\n12.3 Parties to any proceedings in which the Welsh language may be used must also comply with the Practice Direction of 16 October 1998 (relating to proceedings in the Crown Court) and the Practice Direction of 26 April 1999 (relating to civil proceedings). These Practice Directions apply, as appropriate, to proceedings involving a devolution issue in which the Welsh language may be used. Crown Proceedings Act 1947 (Section 19)\n\n13 Where the court has determined that a devolution issue arises, the Attorney General will give any necessary consent to:\n\n(1) the proceedings being transferred to The Law Courts, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF 10 3 PG, or to such other district registry as shall (exceptionally) be directed by the court; and\n\n(2) to the trial taking place at Cardiff or at such other trial location as shall (exceptionally) be directed by the court. PART III DIRECTIONS APPLICABLE TO SPECIFIC PROCEEDINGS\n\nJudicial review proceedings\n\n14.1 Practice Direction 54 D contains provisions about where judicial review proceedings may be started in the Administrative Court. Family proceedings in the magistrates' courts and the High Court\n\n15.1 In any proceedings in which any question with respect to the upbringing of a child arises, the court shall have regard to the general principle that any delay in determining the question is likely to prejudice the welfare of the child 11.\n\n15.2 If the FPR apply, the court will comply with rule 10.21.12\n\n15.3 If Part IV of the FPR applies, the court will comply with rule 4.23.13\n\n15.4 If the FPC apply, the court will comply with Rules 23 and 33 A 14.\n\n15.5 If the proceedings are listed in column (i) of Appendix 3 to the FPR or Schedule 2 to the FPC, a copy of any notice to be given to the parties must also be given to the persons set out in column (iv) of Appendix 3 or Schedule 2 as the case may be.\n\n15.6 A party wishing to raise a devolution issue must, wherever possible, raise it (giving full particulars of the provisions relied on) in the application or answer or at the first directions hearing where appropriate.\n\n15.7 If a party has not raised a devolution issue as above, the party must seek the permission of the court to raise it at a later stage.",

Civil proceedings in the County Court and the High Court\n\n16.1 A party wishing to raise a devolution issue must specify in the claim form, or if he is a defendant, in the defence (or written evidence filed with the acknowledgement of service in a Part 8 claim) that the claim raises a devolution issue and the relevant provisions of the GWA.\n\n16.2 The particulars of claim or defence if the devolution issue is raised by the defendant (or written evidence filed with the acknowledgement of service in a Part 8 claim) must contain the facts and circumstances and points of law on the basis of which it is alleged that a devolution issue arises in sufficient detail to enable the court to determine whether a devolution issue arises in the proceedings.\n\n16.3 Whether or not the allocation rules apply, if a question is raised during the proceedings that might be a devolution issue, then a directions hearing must take place and the matter must be referred to a circuit judge (in County Court actions) or a High Court judge (in High Court actions) for determination as to whether a devolution issue arises and for further directions.\n\n16.4 If a party fails to specify in the appropriate document that a devolution issue arises but that party subsequently wishes to raise a devolution issue, that party must seek the permission of the court.\n\n16.5 Where any party has specified that a devolution issue arises, no default judgment can be obtained. Criminal proceedings in the Crown Court\n\n17 If the defendant wishes to raise a devolution issue he should do so at the Plea and Directions Hearing. Criminal and civil proceedings in the magistrates' courts\n\n18.1\n\n(1) Where a defendant, who has been charged or has had an information laid against him in respect of a criminal offence and has entered a plea of 'Not Guilty', wishes to raise a devolution issue he should, wherever possible, give full particulars of the provisions relied on by notice in writing.\n\n(2) Where a party to a complaint, or applicant for a licence wishes to raise a devolution issue he should, wherever possible, give full particulars of the provisions relied on by notice in writing.\n\n(3) Such notice should be given to the prosecution (and other party if any) and the court as soon as practicable after the 'Not Guilty' plea is entered or the complaint or application is made as the case may be.\n\n18.2 Where proceedings are to be committed or transferred to the Crown Court by the magistrates, the question as to whether a devolution issue arises shall be a matter for the Crown Court. PART IV APPEALS Appeals to the Court of Appeal (Civil and Criminal Division)\n\n19.1 This paragraph applies if a devolution issue is raised in any appeal to either the Civil or the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\n19.2 The devolution issue may already have been raised in the court whose decision is being appealed. The devolution issue may, however, be raised for the first time on appeal.\n\n19.3 Where an application for permission to appeal is made, or an appeal is brought where permission is not needed, the appellant must specify in the application notice (or the notice of appeal or notice of motion as the case may be):\n\n(1) that the appeal raises a devolution issue and the relevant provisions of the GWA;\n\n(2) the facts and circumstances and points of law on the basis of which it is alleged that a devolution issue arises in sufficient detail to enable the court to determine whether a devolution issue arises; and\n\n(3) whether the devolution issue was considered in the court below, and, if so, provide details of the decision.\n\n19.4 An appellant may not seek to raise a devolution issue without the permission of the court after he has filed an application notice; or a notice of appeal or notice of motion (if no application notice).\n\n19.5 Where permission to appeal is sought and a party to the appeal wishes to raise a devolution issue which was not raised in the lower court, the court will determine if a devolution issue arises before deciding whether to grant leave to appeal. Appeals to the Crown Court\n\n20 A notice of appeal from a decision of the magistrates' courts to the Crown Court must specify whether the devolution issue was considered in the court below and if so, provide details of the decision. If it was not so considered, the notice should specify:\n\n(1) that the appeal raises a devolution issue and the relevant provisions of the GWA; and\n\n(2) the facts and circumstances and points of law on the basis of which it is alleged that a devolution issue arises in sufficient detail to enable the court to determine whether a devolution issue arises.

These would not allow them to appeal a decision made in proceedings on indictment, although the Attorney General has a power under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 to refer a point of law to the Court of Appeal where the defendant has been acquitted in a trial on indictment.Paragraph 31, schedule 8 to the GWA, allows the Attorney General and Assembly to refer to the Judicial Committee any devolution issue which is not the subject of proceedings. This power could possibly be used if a court reached a decision where they had not been parties and so had no rights of appeal but such a reference could not affect the decision of the court.\n• If an appeal by way of case stated in criminal proceedings goes to the Divisional Court there appears to be no power for the Divisional Court to refer a devolution issue to the Court of Appeal.\n• For example, in appeals from a magistrates' court in a licensing matter.\n• Custody time limits are imposed by the Prosecution of Offences (Custody Time Limits) Regulations 1987 as amended.\n• See Annex 2 for information about fax numbers and addresses.\n• If there is an appeal, the appeal court will serve a devolution issue notice on the Attorney General and the Assembly (see paragraph 7.4).\n• In criminal cases section 16 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 does not enable a court receiving a reference to make a defendant's costs order. If the defendant is subsequently acquitted by the court who made the reference that court can make a defendant's costs order. However it would not cover the costs of the reference as 'proceedings' is defined in section 21 as including proceedings in any court below but makes no mention of proceedings on a reference.\n• See Annex 2 for the relevant addresses. It shows The Law Courts, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF 10 3 PG and the Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, London WC 2 A 2 LL as alternative addresses for transmitting documents to the Administrative Court Office. If the order is transmitted to Cardiff, the additional copy will be forwarded by the Cardiff Office to the Administrative Court Office in London.\n• Section 1(2), Children Act 1989.\n• Rule 10.21 states: (1) Subject to rule 2.3 [of the FPR] nothing in these rules shall be construed as requiring any party to reveal the address of their private residence (or that of any child) save by order of the court. (2) Where a party declines to reveal an address in reliance upon paragraph (1) above, he shall give notice of that address to the court in Form C 8 and that address shall not be revealed to any person save by order of the court.",

It is not a detailed note of the powers under the 1998 Act which are subject to interpretation by the courts. Subject matter and powers\n\nOfficers of the Competition and Markets Authority ('the CMA') [[if the Judge so orders pursuant to section 28(3 A) of the 1998 Act, insert the following here and elsewhere as indicated] and other persons] have been authorised under Warrant to enter and search the premises identified in the Warrant in connection with an [delete as appropriate: [an investigation under the 1998 Act][a request for assistance from an overseas regulator under Chapter 2 of Part 5 of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (\"the 2024 Act\") (provision of investigative assistance to overseas regulators)]]. The subject matter of this investigation is set out in paragraph 2 of the Warrant. The officers [and other persons] will not elaborate on this.\n\nParagraph 4 of the Warrant sets out the powers of the named officer 2 aand other officers [and other persons] under section 28 of the 1998 Act for the purposes of the present investigation. On entering the premises, the named officer will, as a matter of practice, produce evidence of the identity of the other officers in addition to his identity when producing the Warrant.\n\nUnless the Court has ordered otherwise, the initial production of the Warrant and entry to premises must take place between 9.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. Monday to Friday and, once officers [and other persons] have entered premises under the authority of the Warrant, they may outside those times and whilst the Warrant remains in force, remain on the premises or re-enter the premises to continue executing the Warrant. Access to legal advice\n\nYou are advised to seek legal advice. If the named officer and other officers consider it reasonable in the circumstances to do so and if they are satisfied that you are complying with, or will comply with, such conditions as they consider it appropriate to impose, the named officer and other officers will grant a request to allow a reasonable time for your legal adviser to arrive at the premises before the inspection continues.\n\nIf you decide to seek legal advice you should do so promptly and this must not unduly delay or impede the inspection. Any delay must be kept to a strict minimum.\n\nIf you have an in-house legal adviser on the premises, or if you have received prior notice of the inspection, the named officer and other officers [and other persons] will not wait for your external legal adviser to arrive. Self-incrimination\n\nThe named officer and other officers [and other persons] have powers, among other matters, to search and take copies of, or extracts from, documents covered by the Warrant, to require you to produce information which is stored in any electronic form and to require you to provide an explanation of any such documents (which the 1998 Act defines as including information recorded in any form). However, if your undertaking is suspected of having committed an infringement of the 1998 Act, they cannot require you to provide answers or statements that might involve an admission on your part of the existence of that infringement. If your undertaking is suspected of having committed a breach of the law in the country or territory of the overseas regulator named in paragraph 1 of the Warrant, the CMA expects to take the same approach to self-incrimination.\n\nYou should note also that, any statement made by a person in response to a requirement imposed by the named officer or other officers [or other persons] in exercise of their powers under paragraph 4 of the Warrant, may not be used in evidence against him on a prosecution for an offence under section 188 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the cartel offence) unless, in the proceedings -\n\n• in giving evidence, he makes a statement inconsistent with it, and\n• evidence relating to it is adduced, or a question relating to it is asked, by him or on his behalf. Legally privileged communications\n\nThe powers under section 28 of the 1998 Act to search, take copies etc. (set out in paragraph 4(b) onwards in the Warrant) do not apply in respect of any 'privileged communication'. This is defined in section 30 of the 1998 Act to mean a communication\n\n• between a professional legal adviser and his client, or\n• made in connection with, or in contemplation of, legal proceedings and for the purposes of those proceedings,\n\nwhich would be protected from disclosure in proceedings in the High Court on grounds of legal professional privilege.\n\nFor the purposes of section 30 of the 1998 Act, a 'professional legal adviser' includes both an external and an in-house qualified legal adviser.\n\nIf you consider that a document or information is privileged, you should provide the named officer or other officer [or other person] with material of such a nature as to demonstrate to his satisfaction that the document or information, or parts of it, for which privilege is claimed, fulfil the conditions for it being privileged.\n\nIf you fail to do so, you should gather together the items for which privilege is claimed. These items will not be examined or copied unless you reach an agreement with the named officer that they may be examined or copied. If no agreement is reached on the day of the inspection, the named officer will request that you make a copy of the items and place this in a sealed envelope or package in his presence. The named officer will then discuss with you appropriate arrangements for the safe-keeping of these items pending resolution of the issue of privilege. For example, such arrangements may include a request that your legal adviser should give (or if no legal adviser is present, that you give), a written undertaking that the envelope or package will be retained safely and that its contents will not be concealed, removed, tampered with or destroyed until the issue of privilege is resolved. Listing of items\n\nUnless it is impracticable in all the circumstances, no item may be removed from the premises by the named officer or other officers [or other persons] until they have prepared a list of all the items to be removed, a copy of the list has been supplied to you, and you have been given a reasonable opportunity to check that the list relates to all the items concerned, and only to those items. This does not entitle you or your legal adviser to insist that the list or its contents should take any particular form. Confidentiality\n\nYou should note that, subject to the safeguards in relation to self-incrimination and legal privilege, you arenotentitled to withhold a document or information by claiming that it is confidential.\n\nWhere it is possible to do so, it is suggested that after the inspection on the premises you should identify any part or parts of any information or document copied or taken that you consider to be confidential and provide a written explanation as to why it should be treated as such. For these purposes information is confidential if it is:\n\n• commercial information the disclosure of which would, or might, significantly harm the legitimate business interests of the undertaking to which it relates; or\n• information relating to the private affairs of an individual the disclosure of which would, or might, significantly harm his interests 2.\n\nA document will be treated as confidential to the extent that it contains confidential information.\n\nIt is for the CMA to determine whether or not the information is to be disclosed in accordance with Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002. Application to vary or discharge the Warrant\n\nYou are entitled to apply to the Court to vary or discharge the Warrant. If you intend to make such an application, you must first inform the named officer. An application to stop the Warrant from being executed must be made immediately upon it being served.\n\nThe application must be made to the judge who issued the Warrant, or if he is not available, to another High Court judge.\n\nIf you are making an immediate application to stop the Warrant from being executed, the named officer will delay starting or continuing a search of the premises for a reasonable period (not exceeding two hours) while you make your application, provided that you\n\n• permit the named officer and other officers [and other persons] to enter and remain on the premises;\n• keep the named officer informed of the steps you are taking in relation to the application; and\n• comply with any other conditions that the named officer imposes.\n\nExamples of conditions that the named officer may impose pursuant to (3) above include: that you do not disturb or move any document or information that is the subject of the Warrant; and/or you do not tell anyone other than your legal adviser about the Warrant or the investigation. Application under section 59 Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001\n\nYour attention is drawn to section 59 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which makes provision about applications relating to property seized in the exercise of the powers conferred by (among other provisions) section 28(2) of the 1998 Act.\n\nAn application under section 59 -\n\n• must be made by application notice in accordance with Part 23 of the Civil Procedure Rules; and\n• should be made to a judge of the Chancery Division at the Royal Courts of Justice (if available).\n\nWarrant (PDF - opens in new window) Explanatory Note to Warrant under section 75 of the Digital Markets Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (\"the 2024 Act\")\n\nThis Explanatory Note is provided for information only.

Self-incrimination\n\nThe named officer and the other officers have powers, among other matters, to search and take copies of, or extracts from, documents covered by the Warrant, to require you to produce relevant information which is stored in any electronic form and to require you to provide an explanation of any such documents (which the Regulations define as information recorded in any form).\n\nYou should note that, any statement made by a person in response to a requirement imposed by the named officer or other officer may only be used in evidence against that person for the prosecution of an offence under the Regulations; or on prosecution for any other offence where -\n\n1. in giving evidence, that person makes a statement inconsistent with it; and\n\n2. evidence relating to it is adduced, or a question relating to it is asked, by them or on their behalf. Legally privileged information\n\nThe powers under paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 to the Regulations to search, take copies etc. (set out in paragraph 4(b) onwards in the Warrant) do not apply in respect of any 'privileged communication'. This is defined in paragraph 17 of Schedule 4 to the Regulations to mean a communication -\n\n1. between a professional legal adviser and the adviser's client, or\n\n2. made in connection with, or in contemplation of, legal proceedings and for the purposes of those proceedings,\n\nwhich would be protected from disclosure in proceedings in the High Court on grounds of legal professional privilege.\n\nFor the purposes of paragraph 17 of Schedule 4 to the Regulations, a 'professional legal adviser' includes both an external and an in-house qualified legal adviser.\n\nIf you consider that a document or information is privileged, you should provide the named officer or the other officer with material of such a nature as to demonstrate to the officer's satisfaction that the document or information, or parts of it, for which privilege is claimed, fulfil the conditions for it being privileged.\n\nIf you fail to do so, you should gather together the items for which privilege is claimed. These items will not be examined or copied unless you reach agreement with the named officer that they may be examined or copied. If no agreement is reached whilst the warrant is being executed, the named officer will request that you make a copy of the items and place this in a sealed envelope or package in the named officer's presence. The named officer will then discuss with you the appropriate arrangements for the safe-keeping of these items pending resolution of the issue of privilege. For example, such arrangements may include a request that your legal adviser should give (or if no legal adviser is present, that you give), a written undertaking that the envelope or package will be retained safely and that its contents will not be concealed, removed, tampered with or destroyed until the issue of privilege is resolved. Listing of items\n\nUnless it is impracticable in all the circumstances, no item may be removed from the premises by the named officer or other officers until they have prepared a list of all the items to be removed, a copy of the list has been supplied to you, and you have been given a reasonable opportunity to check that the list relates to all the items concerned, and only to those items. This does not entitle you or your legal adviser to insist that the list or its contents should take any particular form. Confidentiality\n\nYou should note that, subject to the safeguards in relation to self-incrimination and legal privilege, you are not entitled to withhold a document or information claiming that it is confidential.\n\nWhere it is possible to do so, it is suggested that after the entry to the premise you should identify any part or parts of any information or document copied or taken that you consider to be confidential and provide a written explanation as to why it should be treated as such. For these purposes information is confidential if it is:\n\n1. commercial information the disclosure of which the CMA thinks might significantly harm the legitimate business interests of the undertaking to which it relates;\n\n2. information relating to the private affairs of an individual the disclosure of which the CMA thinks might significantly harm the individual's interests; or\n\n3. information the disclosure of which the CMA thinks is contrary to the public interest.\n\nA document will be treated as confidential to the extent that it contains confidential information.\n\nIt is for the CMA to determine whether or not the information is to be disclosed in accordance with Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002. Application to vary or discharge the warrant\n\nYou are entitled to apply to the Court to vary or discharge the Warrant. If you intend to make such an application, you must first inform the named officer. An application to stop the Warrant from being executed must be made immediately upon it being served.\n\nThe application must be made to the judge who issued the Warrant, or if that judge is not available, to another High Court judge.\n\nIf you are making an immediate application to stop the Warrant being executed, the named officer will delay starting or continuing a search of the premises for a reasonable period (not exceeding two hours) while you make your application, provided that you\n\n1. permit the named officer and other officers [and other persons] to enter and remain on the premises;\n\n2. keep the named officer informed of the steps you are taking in relation to the application; and\n\n3. comply with any other conditions that the named officer imposes.\n\nExamples of conditions that the named officer may impose pursuant to (3) above include: that you do not disturb or move any document or information that is the subject of the Warrant; and/or you do not tell anyone other than your legal adviser about the Warrant or the investigation. Application under section 59 Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001\n\nYour attention is drawn to section 59 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which makes provision about applications relating to property seized in the exercise of the powers conferred by (among other provisions) paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 to the Regulations.\n\nAn application under section 59-\n\n1. must be made by application notice in accordance with Part 23 of the Civil Procedure Rules; and\n\n2. should be made to a judge of the Chancery Division at the Royal Courts of Justice (if available). Footnotes\n\n1.

Where a claim for a recovery order has been issued, any interim proceedings preserving the property which is the subject of the claim will be transferred by the Administrative Court to the Central Office of the King's Bench Division. 2.3\n\nThe preceding paragraph does not limit the power of the High Court to transfer claims or applications to or from the Central Office of the King's Bench Division, Administrative Court, Chancery Division or specialist list of the High Court.\n\nUse of pseudonyms by staff 3.1\n\nIf a member of the staff of the relevant Director gives written or oral evidence in any proceedings using a pseudonym in accordance with section 449 or section 449 A of the Act -\n\n(1) the court must be informed that the witness is using a pseudonym; and\n\n(2) a certificate under section 449(3) or 449 A(3) (as appropriate) of the Act must be filed or produced.\n\nSECTION II - CIVIL RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS UNDER PART 5 OF THE ACT OR PART 5 OF THE ORDER IN COUNCIL\n\nClaim for a recovery order 4.1\n\nA claim by the enforcement authority for a recovery order must be made using the CPR Part 8 procedure.\n\n4.2\n\nIn a claim for a recovery order based on an external order, the claim must include an application to register the external order. 4.3\n\nThe claim form must -\n\n(1) identify the property in relation to which a recovery order is sought;\n\n(2) state, in relation to each item or description of property -\n\n(a) whether the property is alleged to be recoverable property or associated property; and\n\n(b) either -\n\n(i) who is alleged to hold the property; or\n\n(ii) where the enforcement authority is unable to identify who holds the property, the steps that have been taken to try to establish their identity;\n\n(3) set out the matters relied upon in support of the claim;\n\n(4) give details of the person nominated by the enforcement authority to act as trustee for civil recovery in accordance with section 267 of the Act or article 178 of the Order in Council; and\n\n(5) in a claim which includes an application to register an external order, be accompanied by a copy of the external order. 4.4\n\nThe evidence in support of the claim must include the signed, written consent of the person nominated by the enforcement authority to act as trustee for civil recovery if appointed by the court. 4.5\n\nIn a claim which includes an application to register an external order, where -\n\n(1) the sum specified in the external order is expressed in a currency other than sterling; and\n\n(2) there are not funds held in the United Kingdom in the currency in which the sum specified is expressed sufficient to satisfy the external order,\n\nthe claim form, or particulars of claim if served subsequently, must state the sterling equivalent of the sum specified.\n\n(Article 145(2) of the Order in Council provides that the sterling equivalent is to be calculated in accordance with the exchange rate prevailing at end of the day on which the external order is made.) Applications\n\n5.1\n\nAn application for a property freezing order, an interim receiving order or a management receiving order must be made -\n\n(1) to a High Court judge; and\n\n(2) in accordance with CPR Part 23.\n\n5.2\n\nCPR rule 23.10(2) and Sections I to V of CPR Part 25 do not apply to applications for property freezing orders, interim receiving orders and management receiving orders. 5.3\n\nThe application may be made without notice in the circumstances set out in -\n\n(1) section 245 A(3) of the Act and article 147(3) of the Order in Council (in the case of an application for a property freezing order);\n\n(2) section 246(3) of the Act and article 151(3) of the Order in Council (in the case of an application for an interim receiving order); or\n\n(3) section 245 E of the Act and article 150 A(3) of the Order in Council (in the case of an application for a management receiving order). 5.4\n\nAn application for a property freezing order must be supported by written evidence which must -\n\n(1) set out the grounds on which the order is sought; and\n\n(2) give details of each item or description of property in respect of which the order is sought, including\n\n(a) an estimate of the value of the property; and\n\n(b) the additional information referred to in paragraph 5.5(2). 5.5\n\nCPR Part 69 (court's power to appoint a receiver) and Practice Direction 69 apply to an application for an interim receiving order with the following modifications -\n\n(1) paragraph 2.1 of Practice Direction 69 does not apply;\n\n(2) the enforcement authority's written evidence must, in addition to the matters required by paragraph 4.1 of that practice direction, also state in relation to each item or description of property in respect of which the order is sought -\n\n(a) whether the property is alleged to be -\n\n(i) recoverable property; or\n\n(ii) associated property,\n\nand the facts relied upon in support of that allegation; and\n\n(b) in the case of any associated property -\n\n(i) who is believed to hold the property; or\n\n(ii) if the enforcement authority is unable to establish who holds the property, the steps that have been taken to establish their identity; and\n\n(3) the enforcement authority's written evidence must always identify a nominee and include the information in paragraph 4.2 of that practice direction. 5.5 A\n\nCPR Part 69 (court's power to appoint a receiver) and Practice Direction 69 apply to an application for a management receiving order with the following modifications-\n\n(1) paragraph 2.1 of Practice Direction 69 does not apply; and(2) the enforcement authority's written evidence must always identify a nominee and include the information in paragraph 4.2 of that Practice Direction. 5.6\n\nWhere an application is made for an interim receiving order or management receiving order, a draft of the order which is sought must be filed with the application notice. This should if possible also be supplied to the court in an electronic form compatible with the word processing software used by the court. Property freezing order or interim receiving order made before commencement of claim for recovery order\n\nA property freezing order or interim receiving order which is made before a claim for a recovery order has been commenced will -\n\n(1) specify a period within which the enforcement authority must either start the claim or apply for the continuation of the order while he carries out his investigation; and\n\n(2) provide that the order will be set aside if the enforcement authority does not start the claim or apply for its continuation before the end of that period. Exclusions when making property freezing order or interim receiving order 5 B.1\n\nWhen the court makes a property freezing order or interim receiving order on an application without notice, it will normally make an initial exclusion from the order for the purpose of enabling the respondent to meet his reasonable legal costs so that he may -\n\n(1) take advice in relation to the order;\n\n(2) prepare a statement of assets in accordance with paragraph 7 A.3; and\n\n(3) if so advised, apply for the order to be varied or set aside.\n\nThe total amount specified in the initial exclusion will not normally exceed £3,000. 5 B.2\n\nWhen it makes a property freezing order or interim receiving order before a claim for a recovery order has been commenced, the court may also make an exclusion to enable the respondent to meet his reasonable legal costs so that (for example) when the claim is commenced -\n\n(1) he may file an acknowledgment of service and any written evidence on which he intends to rely; or\n\n(2) he may apply for a further exclusion for the purpose of enabling him to meet his reasonable costs of the proceedings. 5 B.3\n\nParagraph 7 A contains general provisions about exclusions made for the purpose of enabling a person to meet his reasonable legal costs.\n\nInterim receiving order or management receiving order: application for directions 6.1\n\nAn application for directions as to the exercise of the functions of -\n\n(1) the interim receiver under section 251 of the Act or article 156 of the Order in Council; or\n\n(2) the management receiver under section 245 G of the Act or article 150 C of under the Order in Council,\n\nmay be made at any time by -\n\n(a) the interim receiver or management receiver, as appropriate;\n\n(b) any party to the proceedings; and\n\n(c) any person affected by any action taken, or proposed to be taken, by the interim receiver or management receiver. 6.2\n\nThe application must always be made by application notice, which must be served on -\n\n(1) the interim receiver or management receiver, as appropriate, (unless he is the applicant);\n\n(2) every party to the proceedings; and\n\n(3) any other person who may be interested in the application.\n\nApplication to vary or set aside an order 7.1\n\nAn application to vary or set aside a property freezing order, an interim receiving order or a management receiving order (including an application for, or relating to, an exclusion from the order) may be made at any time by -\n\n(1) the enforcement authority; or\n\n(2) any person affected by the order. 7.2\n\nUnless the court otherwise directs or exceptional circumstances apply, a copy of the application notice must be served on -\n\n(1) every party to the proceedings;\n\n(2) in the case of an application to vary or set aside an interim receiving order or management receiving order, the interim receiver or management receiver (as appropriate); and\n\n(3) any other person who may be affected by the court's decision. 7.2 A\n\nBefore exercising the power to discharge or vary a property freezing order, the court must give an opportunity for the parties, and any other person who may be affected by the court's decision, to be heard, in accordance with section 245 B(5) of the Act or Article 148(5) of the Order in Council (as appropriate). 7.2 B\n\nA Master or District Judge may, with the consent of all the parties, vary or discharge a property freezing order, an interim receiving order or a management receiving order granted by any Judge.\". 7.3\n\nThe evidence in support of an application for an exclusion from a property freezing order or interim receiving order for the purpose of enabling a person to meet his reasonable legal costs must -\n\n(1) contain full details of the stage or stages in civil recovery proceedings in respect of which the costs in question have been or will be incurred;\n\n(2) include a statement of the costs which the person has incurred and an estimation of the costs which the person will incur in relation to each stage to which the application relates;\n\n(3) include a statement of assets containing the information set out in paragraph 7 A.3 (unless the person has previously filed such a statement in the same civil recovery proceedings, or the person has previously filed a statement of assets containing the information set out in paragraph 7 H.3 (for an application for an exclusion from a prohibition order), or in paragraph 18.14 (for an application for an exclusion from an interim freezing order), and there has been no material change in the facts set out in the applicable previous statement);\n\n(4) where the court has previously made an exclusion in respect of any stage to which the application relates, explain why the person's costs will exceed the amount specified in the exclusion for that stage; and\n\n(5) state whether the terms of the exclusion have been agreed with the enforcement authority. 7.3 A\n\nWhere, under paragraph 7.3(2), a person includes in evidence a statement of the costs which the person has incurred, paragraphs 9.5(2) and (3) of Practice Direction 44 apply.\n\nExclusions for the purpose of meeting legal costs: general provisions 7 A.1\n\nSubject to paragraph 7 A.2, when the court makes an order or gives directions in civil recovery proceedings it will at the same time consider whether it is appropriate to make or vary an exclusion for the purpose of enabling any person affected by the order or directions to meet his reasonable legal costs. 7 A.1 A\n\nTo enable the court to consider whether it is appropriate to make or vary an exclusion, the court may order a party to file an estimate of costs (unless the person has previously filed such an estimate in the same civil recovery proceedings and there has been no material change in the facts set out in that estimate). 7 A.2\n\nThe court will not make an exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet his reasonable legal costs, other than an exclusion to meet the costs of taking any of the steps referred to in paragraph 5 B.1, unless that person has made , served and filed a statement of assets. 7 A.3\n\nA statement of assets is a witness statement which sets out all the property which the maker of the statement owns, holds or controls, or in which he has an interest, giving the value, location and details of all such property. Information given in a statement of assets under this practice direction will be used only for the purpose of the civil recovery proceedings. 7 A.4\n\nThe court -\n\n(1) will not make an exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet his reasonable legal costs (including an initial exclusion under paragraph 5 B.1); and\n\n(2) may set aside any exclusion which it has made for that purpose or reduce any amount specified in such an exclusion,\n\nif it is satisfied that the person has property to which the property freezing order or interim receiving order does not apply from which he may meet those costs. 7 A.5\n\nThe court will normally refer to a costs judge any question relating to the amount which an exclusion should allow for reasonable legal costs in respect of proceedings or a stage in proceedings. 7 A.6\n\nAttention is drawn to section 245 C of the Act and article 149 of the Order in Council (in relation to exclusions from property freezing orders) and to section 252 of the Act and article 157 of the Order in Council (in relation to exclusions from interim receiving orders). An exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet his reasonable legal costs must be made subject to the 'required conditions' specified in Part 2 of the Regulations. 7 A.7\n\nAn exclusion made for the purpose of enabling a person to meet his reasonable legal costs will specify -\n\n(1) the stage or stages in civil recovery proceedings to which it relates;\n\n(2) the maximum amount which may be released in respect of legal costs for each specified stage; and\n\n(3) the total amount which may be released in respect of legal costs pursuant to the exclusion. 7 A.8\n\nA person who becomes aware that his legal costs -\n\n(1) in relation to any stage in civil recovery proceedings have exceeded or will exceed the maximum amount specified in the exclusion for that stage; or\n\n(2) in relation to all the stages to which the exclusion relates have exceeded or will exceed the total amount that may be released pursuant to the exclusion,\n\nshould apply for a further exclusion or a variation of the existing exclusion as soon as reasonably practicable. Assessment of costs where recovery order is made 7 B.1\n\nWhere the court -\n\n(1) makes a recovery order in respect of property which was the subject of a property freezing order, a prohibition order or an interim receiving order; and\n\n(2) had made an exclusion from the property freezing order, prohibition order or interim receiving order for the purpose of enabling a person to meet his reasonable legal costs,\n\nthe recovery order will make provision under section 266(8 A) of the Act or article 177(10) of the Order in Council (as appropriate) for the payment of those costs. 7 B.2\n\nWhere the court makes a recovery order which provides for the payment of a person's reasonable legal costs in respect of civil recovery proceedings, it will at the same time order the detailed assessment of those costs. Parts 4 and 5 of the Regulations CPR, Part 47 as modified by Parts 4 and 5 of the Regulations and paragraphs 7 B.3 to 7 B.7 of this Practice Direction (\"the civil recovery costs provisions\") apply to a detailed assessment pursuant to such an order. 7 B.3\n\nIn detailed assessment proceedings to which the civil recovery costs provisions apply-\n\n(1) the paying party is the trustee for civil recovery;\n\n(2) the receiving party is the person whose reasonable legal costs are payable pursuant to provision made in the recovery order under section 266(8 A) of the Act or article 177(10) of the Order in Council; and\n\n(3) the relevant persons for the purpose of rule 47.6(2) includes the enforcement authority or the appropriate officer in addition to the persons referred to in paragraph 5.5 of Practice Direction 47 - Procedure for Detailed Assessment of Costs and Default Provisions. 7 B.4\n\nOn commencing detailed assessment proceedings, the receiving party must, in addition to serving the documents listed in paragraph 5.2 of Practice Direction 47 on the paying party and all other relevant persons, serve a statement giving the date, amount and source of all interim payments which have been released in respect of any of those costs under Part 3 of the Regulations. 7 B.5\n\nBy virtue of regulation 13(2) of the Regulations, detailed assessment proceedings must be commenced not later than 2 months after the date of the recovery order, and a request for a detailed assessment hearing must be filed not later than 2 months after the expiry of the period for commencing the detailed assessment proceedings. 7 B.6\n\nThe documents which must accompany the request for a detailed assessment hearing must include copies of all exclusions from property freezing orders or interim freezing orders made by the court for the purpose of enabling the receiving party to meet the costs which are to be assessed, and of every estimate of costs filed in relation to such an exclusion. 7 B.7\n\nThe receiving party's costs will be assessed on the standard basis, subject to Part 5 of the Regulations (and in particular regulation 17, which specifies the hourly rates which may be allowed).

    "content": "Document: Practice Direction – Civil Recovery Proceedings\nSection: Omitted 14.2\nPart 2 of 2\n==================================================\n(1) it is relevant property identified in an external request, and\n\n(2) proceedings have not been taken in relation to the property under Chapter 2 of Part 5 of the Order in Council. 7 D.5\n\nCPR Part 69 (court's power to appoint a receiver) and Practice Direction 69 apply to an application for a management receiving order with the following modifications-\n\n(1) paragraph 2.1 of Practice Direction 69 does not apply; and\n\n(2) the enforcement authority's written evidence must always identify a nominee and include the information in paragraph 4.2 of that Practice Direction.\n\nExclusions when making prohibition order 7 E.1\n\nWhen the court makes a prohibition order on an application without notice, it will normally make an initial exclusion from the order for the purpose of enabling the respondent to meet their reasonable legal costs so that they may-\n\n(1) take advice in relation to the order;\n\n(2) prepare a statement of assets in accordance with paragraph 7 A.3; and\n\n(3) if so advised, apply for the order to be varied or set aside.\n\nThe total amount specified in the initial exclusion will not normally exceed £3,000. 7 E.2\n\nWhen it makes a prohibition order, the court may also make an exclusion to enable the respondent to meet their reasonable legal costs so that (for example) when the claim is commenced-\n\n(1) the respondent may file an acknowledgment of service and any written evidence on which they intend to rely; or\n\n(2) the respondent may apply for a further exclusion for the purpose of enabling them to meet their reasonable costs of the proceedings. 7 E.3\n\nParagraph 7 H contains general provisions about exclusions made for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs.\n\nReceiving order: application for directions 7 F.1\n\nAn application for directions as to the exercise of the functions of the management receiver under article 141 K of the Order in Council may be made at any time by -\n\n(1) the receiver;\n\n(2) any party to the proceedings; and\n\n(3) any person affected by any action taken, or proposed to be taken, by the receiver. 7 F.2\n\nThe application must always be made by application notice, which must be served on-\n\n(1) the receiver (unless the receiver is the applicant);\n\n(2) every party to the proceedings; and\n\n(3) any other person who may be interested in the application.\n\nApplication to vary or set aside an order 7 G.1\n\nAn application to vary or set aside a prohibition order (including an application for, or relating to, an exclusion from the order) may be made at any time by-\n\n(1) the enforcement authority; or\n\n(2) any person affected by the order.\n\n7 G.2\n\nUnless the court otherwise directs or exceptional circumstances apply, a copy of the application notice must be served on-\n\n(1) every party to the proceedings; and\n\n(2) any other person who may be affected by the court's decision. 7 G.3\n\nBefore exercising the power to discharge or vary a prohibition order, the court must give an opportunity for the parties, and any other person who may be affected by the court's decision, to be heard, in accordance with article 141 E of the Order in Council. 7 G.4\n\nThe evidence in support of an application for an exclusion from a prohibition order for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs must-\n\n(1) contain full details of the stage or stages in proceedings under Part 4 A of the Order in Council in respect of which the costs in question have been or will be incurred;\n\n(2) include an estimate of the costs which the person has incurred and will incur in relation to each stage to which the application relates;\n\n(3) include a statement of assets containing the information set out in paragraph 7 A.3 (unless the person has previously filed such a statement in the same proceedings and there has been no material change in the facts set out in that statement);\n\n(4) where the court has previously made an exclusion in respect of any stage to which the application relates, explain why the person's costs will exceed the amount specified in the exclusion for that stage; and\n\n(5) state whether the terms of the exclusion have been agreed with the enforcement authority. 7 G.5\n\nWhere, under paragraph 7 G.4(2), a person includes in evidence a statement of the costs which the person has incurred, paragraphs 9.5(2) and (3) of Practice Direction 44 apply.\n\n7 G.6\n\nA Master or District Judge may, with the consent of all the parties, vary or discharge a prohibition order granted by any judge.\n\nExclusions for the purpose of meeting legal costs: general provisions 7 H.1\n\nSubject to paragraph 7 H.2, when the court makes a prohibition order it will at the same time consider whether it is appropriate to make or vary an exclusion for the purpose of enabling any person affected by the order or directions to meet their reasonable legal costs. 7 H.2\n\nTo enable the court to consider whether it is appropriate to make or vary an exclusion, the court may order a party to file an estimate of costs (unless the person has previously filed such an estimate in the same proceedings and there has been no material change in the facts set out in that estimate). 7 H.3\n\nThe court will not make an exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs, other than an exclusion to meet the costs of taking any of the steps referred to in paragraph 7 E.1, unless that person has made, served and filed a statement of assets. 7 H.4\n\nA statement of assets is a witness statement which sets out all the property which the maker of the statement owns, holds or controls, or in which the maker of the statement has an interest, giving the value, location and details of all such property. Information given in a statement of assets under this practice direction will be used only for the purpose of the prohibition order proceedings, or in support of an application for an exclusion from a property freezing order or interim receiving order for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs (see paragraph 7.3). 7 H.5\n\nThe court-\n\n(1) will not make an exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs (including an initial exclusion under paragraph 7 E.1); and\n\n(2) may set aside any exclusion which it has made for that purpose or reduce any amount specified in such an exclusion,if it is satisfied that the person has property to which the prohibition order does not apply from which the person may meet those costs. 7 H.6\n\nThe court will normally refer to a costs judge any question relating to the amount which an exclusion should allow for reasonable legal costs in respect of proceedings or a stage in proceedings.\n\n7 H.7\n\nAttention is drawn to article 141 G of the Order in Council (in relation to exclusions from prohibition orders). An exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs must be made subject to the 'required conditions' specified in Part 2 of the Regulations. 7 H.8\n\nAn exclusion made for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs will specify the maximum amount which may be released in respect of legal costs.\n\n7 H.9\n\nA person who becomes aware that their legal costs will exceed the maximum amount specified should apply for a further exclusion or a variation of the existing exclusion as soon as reasonably practicable.\".

Application to extend the determination period 18.10 A\n\nAn application under section 362 DA of the Act to extend the determination period must-\n\n(a) be made to a High Court judge;\n\n(b) be made in accordance with CPR Part 23; and\n\n(c) explain, pursuant to section 362 DA-\n\n(i) the work that the enforcement authority is undertaking towards making a determination under section 362 D(2);\n\n(ii) why further time is needed for the authority to make that determination; and\n\n(iii) why it is reasonable in all the circumstances for the period to be extended.\n\n(Section 362 DA of the Act specifies the limits which apply to an extension of the determination period.) Exclusions from interim freezing order for the purpose of meeting legal costs: general provisions 18.11\n\nSubject to paragraph 18.12 when the court makes an interim freezing order on an application without notice, it will normally make an initial exclusion from the order for the purpose of enabling the respondent or, if applicable, the specified responsible officer to meet their reasonable legal costs so that they may-\n\n(1) take advice in relation to the order;\n\n(2) prepare a statement of assets in accordance with paragraph 18.14; and\n\n(3) if so advised, apply for the order to be varied or set aside.\n\nThe total amount specified in the initial exclusion will not normally exceed £3,000. 18.12\n\nTo enable the court to consider whether it is appropriate to make or vary an exclusion, the court may order a party to file an estimate of costs.\n\n18.13\n\nThe court will not make an exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs, other than an exclusion to meet the costs of taking any of the steps referred to in paragraph 18.11, unless that person has made, served and filed a statement of assets. 18.14\n\nA statement of assets is a witness statement which sets out all the property which a person owns, holds or controls, or in which the person has an interest, giving the value, location and details of all such property. Information given in a statement of assets under this practice direction will be used only for the purpose of the civil recovery proceedings or in support of an application for an exclusion from a property freezing order or interim receiving order for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs (see paragraph 7.3). 18.15\n\nIf the court is satisfied that a person has property to which the interim freezing order does not apply and from which the person may meet their or, if applicable, the specified responsible officer's reasonable legal costs, it-\n\n(1) will not make an exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet those reasonable legal costs (including an initial exclusion under paragraph 18.11); and\n\n(2) may set aside any exclusion which it has made for that purpose or reduce any amount specified in such an exclusion. 18.16\n\nThe court will normally refer to a costs judge any question relating to the amount which an exclusion should allow for reasonable legal costs in respect of proceedings under Chapter 2 of Part 8 of the Act. or a stage in those proceedings.\n\n18.17\n\nAttention is drawn to section 362 L of the Act. An exclusion for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs must be made subject to the 'required conditions' specified in Part 2 of the Regulations. 18.18\n\nAn exclusion made for the purpose of enabling a person to meet their reasonable legal costs will specify-\n\n(1) the stage or stages in proceedings under Chapter 2 of Part 8 of the Act to which it relates;\n\n(2) the maximum amount which may be released in respect of legal costs for each specified stage; and\n\n(3) the total amount which may be released in respect of legal costs pursuant to the exclusion. 18.19\n\nA person should apply for a further exclusion or variation of an existing exclusion as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware that their legal costs-\n\n(1) in relation to any stage in proceedings under Chapter 2 of Part 8 of the Act have exceeded or will exceed the maximum amount specified in the exclusion for that stage; or\n\n(2) in relation to all the stages to which the exclusion relates have exceeded or will exceed the total amount that may be released pursuant to the exclusion.

OFT officers can be\naccompanied by one or more named individuals authorised to assist them to\nexecute the warrant under section 194(4) of the Act. The subject matter of this\ninvestigation is set out in paragraph 2 of the Warrant. The officers and any\naccompanying persons will not elaborate on this.\n\nParagraph 3 of the Warrant sets out the powers of the\nnamed officer 1 and other officers and\nany accompanying persons under section 194 of the Act for the purposes of the\npresent investigation. On entering the premises, the named officer will, as a\nmatter of practice, produce evidence of his identity when producing the\nWarrant, and identify and introduce all other officers and any accompanying\npersons, unless he has reasonable grounds for believing that alerting the\noccupier or any other person entitled to grant access would frustrate the\nobject of the search or endanger any officers or accompanying persons.\n\nOfficers of the OFT and any accompanying persons shall\nhave regard to the provisions of Code B of the Code of Practice under the\nPolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, including in Scotland. A copy of Code B\nof the Codes of Practice will be made available on request.\n\nReasonable and proportionate force may be used to enter\npremises if the named officer in charge of the search is satisfied that\npremises are those specified in the warrant and the occupier or any other\nperson entitled to grant access has refused entry or it is impossible to\ncommunicate with the occupier or any other person entitled to grant access. If\nthe occupier is not present, a copy of the warrant and of the notice of the\npowers to search premises and the rights of occupiers shall be left in a\nprominent place on the premises, recording the date and time of the search and\nthe name of the named officer.\n\nIf premises have been entered by force, before leaving\nthe named officer must make sure that they are secure either by arranging for\nthe occupier or the occupier's representative to be present or by any\nother appropriate means.\n\nUnless the Court has ordered otherwise, the initial\nproduction of the Warrant and entry to premises must take place at a reasonable\nhour unless this might frustrate the purpose of the search; and, once officers\nand any accompanying persons have entered premises under the authority of the\nWarrant, they may remain on the premises or re-enter the premises to continue\nexecuting the Warrant.\n\nThe named officer shall also provide the occupier with\nthis Notice of the powers to search premises and the rights of\noccupiers.\n\nOFT officers also have the power in\naccordance with section 50 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 to seize\nmaterial where it is not reasonably practicable, while on the premises, to\ndetermine the extent to which it may be seized, if at all, or for the seizable\nmaterial to be separated from the non-seizable material in which it is\ncomprised. Where this power is to be exercised, the occupier will be given a\nNotice which sets out the grounds for the exercise of the power and the rights\nof persons who have an interest in the property to be seized pursuant to the\npower.\n\n---\n\nAccess to legal advice\n\nWhen executing a warrant OFT officers are not required\nto wait for an occupier or other person's legal adviser to be present\nbefore commencing the search.\n\nHowever, generally the OFT officers will wait for a\nlegal adviser before commencing a search provided the search is not\nunreasonably delayed. Where the OFT officers do wait for the legal\nadviser's arrival, they will wait on the premises and all persons on the\npremises will be required to adhere to appropriate instructions to ensure that\nmaterial on the premises, or on other premises, which may be relevant to the\ninvestigation, is not interfered or tampered with.\n\nFurthermore, in cases where the OFT\nhas commenced the search without waiting for a legal adviser to arrive, the OFT\nwould avoid removing any material from the premises until the person's\nlegal adviser has arrived and had the opportunity to make representations. This\nis provided that the conclusion of the search is not unreasonably\ndelayed.\n\n---\n\nWitness to the search\n\nA friend, neighbour or other person will be allowed to\nwitness the search if the occupier wishes unless the named officer in charge of\nthe search has reasonable grounds for believing that the presence of such\nperson would unreasonably delay the investigation or endanger officers or other\npeople.\n\nA record of the action taken,\nincluding the grounds for refusing a request from the occupier to have a\nwitness to the search, will be made on the premises search record.\n\n---\n\nProtection against\nself-incrimination\n\nThe OFT has the power to require any person at the\npremises to provide an explanation of any document appearing to be of the\nrelevant kind or to state, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief,\nwhere it may be found. This power is used to enable the OFT to direct its\nsearch efficiently and effectively.\n\nIt should be noted that, any statement made by a person\nin response to any such requirement imposed by the named officer or other\nofficers or accompanying persons in exercise of their powers under paragraph\n3(c) of the Warrant (the 'earlier statement'), may only be used in\nevidence against that person in the following circumstances.\n\nOn a prosecution for an offence under\nsection 201(2) of the Act\n\nWhere that person has knowingly or recklessly made a\nstatement that is false or misleading in a material particular in response to\nthat requirement.\n\nOn a prosecution for some other\noffence\n\nWhere he makes a statement\ninconsistent with the earlier statement provided evidence relating to the\nearlier statement is adduced or a question relating to it is asked by him or on\nhis behalf in that prosecution 2.\n\n---\n\nPrivileged\ncommunications\n\nThe powers under section 194 of the Act in relation to\ndocuments and information (set out in paragraph 3(b) onwards in the Warrant) do\nnot apply to communications benefiting from legal professional privilege\n('privilege'). A person may not be required to disclose any\ninformation or produce any document which he would be entitled to refuse to\ndisclose or produce on grounds of privilege in proceedings in the High Court.\nHowever, a lawyer may be required to provide the name and address of his client\nas part of an investigation being conducted under the powers in the Act.\nPrivilege does not apply to communications made with the intention of\nfurthering a criminal purpose (whether the lawyer is acting unwittingly or\nculpably).\n\nThe Act also provides a safeguard in respect of\nconfidential banking information. A person may not be required to disclose any\ninformation or produce any document in respect of which he owes an obligation\nof confidence by virtue of carrying on any banking business, unless the person\nto whom the obligation of confidence is owed consents to the disclosure or\nproduction or the OFT has authorised the making of the requirement.\n\nIf you consider that a document or information is\nsubject to privilege, you should provide the named officer or other officer or\naccompanying person with a sufficient explanation such as to demonstrate to his\nsatisfaction that the document or information, or parts of it, for which\nprivilege is claimed, fulfil the conditions for it being privileged.\n\nIf no agreement is reached during the\nsearch as to whether the conditions for privilege have been made out in\nrelation to particular documents or information, the named officer will request\nthat the documents or information are placed in a sealed opaque bag in his\npresence. The named officer will then discuss with you appropriate arrangements\nfor the safe-keeping of the documents or information by the OFT pending\nresolution of the issue of privilege.\n\n---\n\nListing of items\n\nUnless it is impracticable in all the\ncircumstances, items will not be removed from the premises by the named officer\nor other officers or accompanying persons until a list has been prepared by the\nnamed officer (or other officers or accompanying persons) of all the items to\nbe removed, a copy of the list has been supplied to you, and you have been\ngiven a reasonable opportunity to check that the list relates to all the items\nconcerned, and only to those items.\n\n---\n\nRetention and copying of\nitems\n\nItems seized during the search will be retained by the\nOFT only for as long as is necessary in all the circumstances. For example,\nmaterial seized may be retained if it will be needed -\n\n• for use in evidence in a criminaltrial;\n• to satisfy the OFT's criminaldisclosure obligations; or\n• so that it may be subjected to forensicexamination.\n\nMaterial may also be retained under the provisions of\nthe Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.\n\nOn request, the OFT will, where\npracticable, provide a copy of such material to the person from whom the\nmaterial was seized as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\n---\n\nConfidentiality\n\nYou should note that, subject to the safeguards in\nrelation to self-incrimination and communications subject to privilege, you arenotentitled to withhold a document or information by claiming\nthat it is confidential.\n\nHowever, section 237 of the Act\nimposes limits on the disclosure of information that relates to the affairs of\nany individual or any business which has been obtained by the OFT as a result\nof using its powers of investigation under the Act, subject to certain\nexceptions. Those exceptions include the right of the OFT to disclose\ninformation for the purpose of facilitating the exercise by the OFT of its\nstatutory function and the investigation of any criminal offence in any part of\nthe UK. The relevant provisions are in Part 9 of the Act.\n\n---\n\nApplication to vary or discharge\nthe Warrant\n\nYou are entitled to apply to the Court to vary or\ndischarge the Warrant. If you intend to make such an application, you must\nfirst inform the named officer. An application to stop the Warrant from being\nexecuted must be made immediately upon it being served.\n\nThe application must be made to the judge who issued the\nWarrant, or if he is not available, to another judge of the Chancery\nDivision.\n\nIf you are making an immediate application to stop the\nWarrant from being executed, the named officer will delay starting or\ncontinuing a search of the premises for a reasonable period (not exceeding two\nhours) while you make your application, provided that you -\n\n• permit the named officer and other officers[and other accompanying persons] to enter and remain on thepremises;\n• keep the named officer informed of thesteps you are taking in relation to the application;\n• provide the named officer with contactdetails of the solicitor, if any, who is in receipt of your formal instructionsin relation to an application to stop the Warrant being executed;and\n• comply with any other conditions that thenamed officer imposes.\n\nExamples of conditions that the named\nofficer may impose pursuant to (4) above include -\n\n• that you do not disturb or move anydocument or information that is the subject of the Warrant;and/or\n• you do not tell anyone other than yourlegal adviser about the Warrant or the investigation.\n\n---\n\nApplication under section 59\nCriminal Justice and Police Act 2001\n\nYour attention is drawn to section 59 of the Criminal\nJustice and Police Act 2001, which makes provision about applications relating\nto property seized in the exercise of the powers conferred by (among other\nprovisions) section 194(2) of the Act.\n\nAn application under section 59 should\nbe made to a judge of the Crown Court.\n\n---\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. The named officer is the principal officer\nof the OFT who, together with other officers and accompanying persons, is\nauthorised by the Warrant to exercise the powers under section 194 of the Act.\nHis name and the names of the other officers and accompanying persons are set\nout in Schedule B to the Warrant.\n\n2.
