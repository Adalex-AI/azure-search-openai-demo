The court officer may do so in those cases provided that:\n\n(1) none of the parties is a litigant in person, and\n\n(2) the approval of the court is not required by the Rules, a practice direction or any enactment 4.\n\n3.2 If a consent order filed for sealing appears to be unclear or incorrect the court officer may refer it to a judge for consideration 5.\n\n3.3 Where a consent judgment or order does not come within the provisions of rule 40.6(2):\n\n(1) an application notice requesting a judgment or order in the agreed terms should be filed with the draft judgment or order to be entered or sealed, and\n\n(2) the draft judgment or order must be drawn so that the judge's name and judicial title can be inserted.\n\n3.4 A consent judgment or order must:\n\n(1) be drawn up in the terms agreed,\n\n(2) bear on it the words 'By Consent', and\n\n(3) be signed by\n\n(a) solicitors or counsel acting for each of the parties to the order, or\n\n(b) where a party is a litigant in person, the litigant 6.\n\n3.5 Where the parties draw up a consent order in the form of a stay of proceedings on agreed terms, disposing of the proceedings 7,and where the terms are recorded in a schedule to the order, any direction for:\n\n(1) payment of money out of court, or\n\n(2) payment and assessment of costs\n\nshould be contained in the body of the order and not in the schedule.\n\n---\n\nCorrection of errors in judgments and orders\n\n4.1 Where a judgment or order contains an accidental slip or omission a party may apply for it to be corrected 8.\n\n4.2 The application notice (which may be an informal document such as a letter) should describe the error and set out the correction required. An application may be dealt with without a hearing:\n\n(1) where the applicant so requests,\n\n(2) with the consent of the parties, or\n\n(3) where the court does not consider that a hearing would be appropriate.\n\n4.3 The judge may deal with the application without notice if the slip or omission is obvious or may direct notice of the application to be given to the other party or parties.\n\n4.4 If the application is opposed it should, if practicable, be listed for hearing before the judge who gave the judgment or made the order.\n\n4.5 The court has an inherent power to vary its own orders to make the meaning and intention of the court clear.\n\n---\n\nAdjustment of final judgment figure in respect of Compensation Recovery Payments\n\n5.1 In a final judgment where some or all of the damages awarded -\n\n(1) fall under the heads of damage set out in column 1 of Schedule 2 to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 ('the 1997 Act') in respect of recoverable benefits received by the claimant set out in column 2 of that Schedule; and\n\n(2) where the defendant has paid to the Secretary of State the recoverable benefits in accordance with the certificate (as defined in rule 36.20(1)(e)),\n\nthere will be stated in the preamble to the judgment or order the amount awarded under each head of damage and the amount by which it has been reduced in accordance with section 8 of and Schedule 2 to the 1997 Act.\n\n5.1 AWhere damages are awarded in a case where a lump sum payment (to be construed in accordance with section 1 A of the 1997 Act) has been made to a dependant, then section 15 of the 1997 Act (as modified by Schedule 1 to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits)(Lump Sum Payments) Regulations 2008 sets out what the court order must contain.\n\n5.2 The judgment or order should then provide for entry of judgment and payment of the balance.\n\n---\n\nAdjustment of final judgment figure in respect of an interim payment\n\n6.1 In a final judgment 9 where an interim payment has previously been made which is less than the total amount awarded by the judge, the judgment or order should set out in a preamble:\n\n(1) the total amount awarded by the judge, and\n\n(2) the amount and date of the interim payment(s).\n\n6.2 The total amount awarded by the judge should then be reduced by the total amount of any interim payments, and the judgment or order should then provide for entry of judgment and payment of the balance.\n\n6.3 In a final judgment where an interim payment has previously been made which is more than the total amount awarded by the judge, the judgment or order should set out in a preamble;\n\n(1) the total amount awarded by the judge, and\n\n(2) the amount and date of the interim payment(s).\n\n6.4 An order should then be made for repayment, reimbursement, variation or discharge under rule 25.20(6) and for interest on an overpayment under rule 25.20(8).\n\n---\n\nStatement as to service of a claim form\n\n7.1 Where a party to proceedings which have gone to trial requires a statement to be included in the judgment as to where, and by what means the claim form issued in those proceedings was served, application should made to the trial judge when judgment is given.\n\n7.2 If the judge so orders, the statement will be included in a preamble to the judgment as entered.\n\n---\n\nOrders requiring an act to be done\n\n8.1 An order which requires an act to be done (other than a judgment or order for the payment of an amount of money) must specify the time within which the act should be done.\n\n8.2 The consequences of failure to do an act within the time specified may be set out in the order. In this case the wording of the following examples suitably adapted must be used:\n\n(1) Unless the [claimant][defendant] serves his list of documents by 4.00 p.m. on Friday, January 22, 1999 his [claim][defence] will be struck out and judgment entered for the [defendant][claimant], or\n\n(2) Unless the [claimant][defendant] serves his list of documents within 14 days of service of this order his [claim][defence] will be struck out and judgment entered for the [defendant][claimant].\n\nExample (1) should be used wherever possible.\n\n---\n\nNon-compliance with an injunction or undertaking\n\n9 Part 81 deals with applications and proceedings in relation to contempt of court. Rule 81.4(2)(e) requires that a contempt application must include a statement that an order allegedly breached or disobeyed included a penal notice.\n\n---\n\nForeign currency\n\n10 Where judgment is ordered to be entered in a foreign currency, the order should be in the following form:\n\nIt is ordered that the defendant pay the claimant (state the sum in the foreign currency) or the Sterling equivalent at the time of payment.\n\n---\n\nCosts\n\n11.1 Attention is drawn to-\n\n(1) Practice Direction 44 - General Rules about Costs and, in particular to Subsections 8 and 9 of that Practice Direction which relate to the court's power to make a summary assessment of costs; and\n\n(2) rule 47.20 and Practice Direction 47 - Procedure for Detailed Assessment of Costs and Default Provisions, and in particular the provisions relating to interest in detailed assessment proceedings.\n\n11.2 Attention is also drawn to costs rule 44.10(1) which provides that if an order makes no mention of costs, none are payable in respect of the proceedings to which it relates.\n\n---\n\nJudgments paid by instalments\n\n12 Where a judgment is to be paid by instalments, the judgment should set out:\n\n(1) the total amount of the judgment,\n\n(2) the amount of each instalment,\n\n(3) the number of instalments and the date on which each is to be paid, and\n\n(4) to whom the instalments should be paid.\n\n---\n\nOrder to make an order of the Supreme Court an order of the High Court\n\n13.1 Application may be made in accordance with Part 23 for an order to make an order of the Supreme Court an order of the High Court.
