Appendix B sets out the Standard Directions that the court may give. Appendix C sets out Special Directions that the court may give.\n\n2.3 Before allocating the claim to the Small Claims Track and giving directions for a hearing the court may require a party to give further information about that party's case.\n\n2.4 A party may ask the court to give particular directions about the conduct of the case.\n\n2.5 In deciding whether to make an order for exchange of witness statements the court will have regard to the following -\n\n(a) whether either or both the parties are represented;\n\n(b) the amount in dispute in the proceedings;\n\n(c) the nature of the matters in dispute;\n\n(d) whether the need for any party to clarify his case can better be dealt with by an order under paragraph 2.3;\n\n(e) the need for the parties to have access to justice without undue formality, cost or delay.\n\n---\n\nRepresentation at a hearing\n\n3.1 In this paragraph:\n\n(1) a lawyer means a barrister, a solicitor or a legal executive employed by a solicitor or any other person authorised under the Legal Services Act 2007 to act as a litigator or advocate; and\n\n(2) a lay representative means any other person.\n\n3.2\n\n(1) A party may present his own case at a hearing or a lawyer or lay representative may present it for him.\n\n(2) The Lay Representatives (Right of Audience) Order 1999 provides that a lay representative may not exercise any right of audience:-\n\n(a) where his client does not attend the hearing;\n\n(b) at any stage after judgment; or\n\n(c) on any appeal brought against any decision made by the district judge in the proceedings.\n\n(3) However the court, exercising its general discretion to hear anybody, may hear a lay representative even in circumstances excluded by the Order.\n\n(4) Any of its officers or employees may represent a corporate party.\n\n---\n\nSmall claim hearing\n\n4.1 OMITTED\n\n4.2 A hearing that takes place at the court will generally be in the judge's room but it may take place in a courtroom.\n\n4.3 Rule 27.8 allows the court to adopt any method of proceeding that it considers to be fair and to limit cross-examination. The judge may in particular:\n\n(1) ask questions of any witness himself before allowing any other person to do so,\n\n(2) ask questions of all or any of the witnesses himself before allowing any other person to ask questions of any witnesses,\n\n(3) refuse to allow cross-examination of any witness until all the witnesses have given evidence in chief,\n\n(4) limit cross-examination of a witness to a fixed time or to a particular subject or issue, or both.\n\n---\n\nRecording evidence and the giving of reasons\n\n5.1 A hearing that takes place at the court will be tape recorded by the court. A party may obtain a transcript of such a recording on payment of the proper transcriber's charges.\n\n5.2 Attention is drawn to section 9 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 (which deals with the unauthorised use of tape recorders in court) and to the Practice Direction ([1981] 1 WLR 1526) which relates to it.\n\n5.3\n\n(1) The judge may give reasons for his judgment as briefly and simply as the nature of the case allows.\n\n(2) He will normally do so orally at the hearing, but he may give them later at a hearing either orally or in writing.\n\n5.4 Where the judge decides the case without a hearing under rule 27.10 or a party who has given notice under rule 27.9(1) does not attend the hearing, the judge will prepare a note of his reasons and the court will send a copy to each party.\n\n5.5 Nothing in this practice direction affects the duty of a judge at the request of a party to make a note of the matters referred to in section 80 of the County Courts Act 1984.\n\n---\n\nNon-attendance of a party at a hearing\n\n6.1 Attention is drawn to rule 27.9 (which enables a party to give notice that he will not attend a final hearing and sets out the effect of his giving such notice and of not doing so), and to paragraph 3 above.\n\n6.2 Nothing in those provisions affects the general power of the court to adjourn a hearing, for example where a party who wishes to attend a hearing on the date fixed cannot do so for a good reason.\n\n---\n\nCosts\n\n7.1 Attention is drawn to Rule 27.14 which contains provisions about the costs which may be ordered to be paid by one party to another.\n\n7.2 The amount which a party may be ordered to pay under rule 27.14(2)(b) (for legal advice and assistance in claims including an injunction or specific performance) is a sum not exceeding £260.\n\n7.3 The amounts which a party may be ordered to pay under rule 27.14(2)(e) (loss of earnings) and (f) (experts' fees) are:\n\n(1) for the loss of earnings or loss of leave of each party or witness due to attending a hearing or staying away from home for the purpose of attending a hearing, a sum not exceeding £95 per day for each person, and\n\n(2) for experts' fees, a sum not exceeding £750 for each expert.\n\n(As to recovery of pre-allocation costs in a case in which an admission by the defendant has reduced the amount in dispute to a figure below £10,000, reference should be made to paragraph 7.4 of Practice Direction 26 and to paragraph 7.1(3) of Practice Direction 46.)\n\n---\n\nAppeals\n\n8.1 Part 52 deals with appeals and attention is drawn to that Part and Practice Direction 52.\n\n8 AAn appellant's notice in small claims must be filed and served in Form N 164.\n\n8.2 Where the court dealt with the claim to which the appellant is a party:\n\n(1) under rule 27.10 without a hearing; or\n\n(2) in his absence because he gave notice under rule 27.9 requesting the court to decide the claim in his absence,\n\nan application for permission to appeal must be made to the appeal court.\n\n8.3 Where an appeal is allowed the appeal court will, if possible, dispose of the case at the same time without referring the claim to the lower court or ordering a new hearing.
