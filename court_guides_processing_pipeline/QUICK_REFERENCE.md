# Court Guides Processing — Quick Reference

**Folder:** `court_guides_processing_pipeline/`  
**Status:** Organized (Jan 2026) — Ready for implementation  
**Key Doc:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

***

## The 5-Minute Summary

### What?
UK court guide PDFs are converted to JSON and indexed in Azure AI Search for legal RAG search.

### Current State
- ✅ 5 guides processed and indexed (698 sections total)
- ⚠️ No automated pipeline (manual process)
- ⚠️ Scripts not version-controlled

### Plan
6-phase implementation to fully automate:
1. Recover missing scripts (2-3 weeks)
2. Evaluate parsing strategy (1-2 weeks)
3. Build unified pipeline (3-4 weeks)
4. Add change monitoring (2-3 weeks)
5. CI/CD integration (2-3 weeks)
6. Documentation & handoff (1 week)

**Total:** ~10 weeks (7-8 weeks with parallelization)

### Why?
- Court guides update annually → automatable
- Manual process error-prone → standardize
- Monitoring gaps → miss important updates
- Scripts missing → can't reproduce

## Key Decisions Pending

| Decision | Options | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Parser** | Keep Docling OR switch to Azure DI? | Cost vs. quality |
| **Automation Priority** | Phase 3 first OR Phase 4 first? | Speed to value vs. monitoring |
| **Ownership** | Who maintains after implementation? | Support model |
| **SLA** | Same-day updates OR weekly batch? | Operational load |

## Implementation Phases at a Glance

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Owner | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Recover scripts | 2-3w | Engineer | 🚧 Pending |
| 2 | Evaluate parsers | 1-2w | Engineer | 🚧 Pending |
| 3 | Build pipeline | 3-4w | Engineer | 🚧 Pending |
| 4 | Add monitoring | 2-3w | DevOps | 🚧 Pending |
| 5 | CI/CD + tests | 2-3w | DevOps | 🚧 Pending |
| 6 | Handoff + docs | 1w | Team | 🚧 Pending |

## Success Metrics

✅ All scripts recovered and tested  
✅ Single command to process all guides  
✅ Automated detection of guide changes  
✅ 95%+ content retention  
✅ Full CI/CD integration  
✅ Complete operator runbook

## Next Steps

1. **Review** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (detailed read: 20 mins)
2. **Decide** on parser strategy (Phase 2)
3. **Assign** owners for each phase
4. **Schedule** Phase 1 kickoff
5. **Monitor** progress against timeline
