The Court Settlement Process under this Order is a confidential, voluntary and non-binding dispute resolution process in which the Settlement Judge assists the Parties in reaching an amicable settlement at a Court Settlement Conference.\\n2. This Order provides for the process by which the Court assists in the resolution of the disputes in the Proceedings. This Order is made by consent of the Parties with a view to achieving the amicable settlement of such disputes. It is agreed that the Settlement Judge may vary this Order at any time as he thinks appropriate or in accordance with the agreement of the Parties.\\n3. The following definitions shall apply:\\n1) The Parties shall be [names]\\n2) The Proceedings are [identify]\\n3) The Settlement Judge is [name]\\nThe Court Settlement Process\\n4. The Settlement Judge may conduct the Court Settlement Process in such manner, as the Judge considers appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the wishes of the Parties and the overriding objective in Part 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. A Preliminary Court Settlement Conference shall be held, either in person or in some other convenient manner, at which the Parties and the Settlement Judge shall determine, in general terms, the procedure to be adopted for the Court Settlement Process, the venue of the Court Settlement Conference, the estimated duration of the Court Settlement Conference and the material which will be read by the Settlement Judge in advance of the Court Settlement Conference.\\n5. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, during the Court Settlement Conference the Settlement Judge may communicate with the Parties together or with any Party separately, including private meetings at which the Settlement Judge may express views on the disputes. Each Party shall cooperate with the Settlement Judge. A Party may request a private meeting with the Settlement Judge at any time during the Court Settlement Conference. The Parties shall give full assistance to enable the Court Settlement Conference to proceed and be concluded within the time stipulated by the Settlement Judge.\\n6. In advance of the Court Settlement Conference, each Party shall notify the Settlement Judge and the other Party or Parties of the names and the role of all persons involved in the Court Settlement Conference. Each Party shall nominate a person having full authority to settle the disputes.\\n7. No offers or promises or agreements shall have any legal effect unless and until they are included in a written agreement signed by representatives of all Parties (the \\\"Settlement Agreement\\\").\\n8. If the Court Settlement Conference does not lead to a Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Judge may, if requested by the Parties, send the Parties such assessment setting out his views on such matters as the Parties shall request, which may include, for instance, his views on the disputes, his views on prospects of success on individual issues, the likely outcome of the case and what would be an appropriate settlement. Such assessment shall be confidential to the parties and may not be used or referred to in any subsequent proceedings.\\nTermination of the Settlement Process\\n9. The Court Settlement Process shall come to end upon the signing of a Settlement Agreement by the Parties in respect of the disputes or when the Settlement Judge so directs or upon written notification by any Party at any time to the Settlement Judge and the other Party or Parties that the Court Settlement Process is terminated.\\nConfidentiality\\n10. The Court Settlement Process is private and confidential. Every document, communication or other form of information disclosed, made or produced by any Party specifically for the purpose of the Court Settlement Process shall be treated as being disclosed on a privileged and without prejudice basis and no privilege or confidentiality shall be waived by such disclosure.\\n11. Nothing said or done during the course of the Court Settlement Process is intended to or shall in any way affect the rights or prejudice the position of the Parties to the dispute in the Proceedings or any subsequent arbitration, adjudication or litigation. If the Settlement Judge is told by a Party that information is being provided to the Settlement Judge in confidence, the Settlement Judge will not disclose that information to any other Party in the course of the Court Settlement Process or to any other person at any time.\\nCosts\\n12. Unless otherwise agreed, each Party shall bear its own costs and shall share equally the Court costs of the Court Settlement Process.\\nSettlement Judge's Role in Subsequent Proceedings\\n13. The Settlement Judge shall from the date of this Order not take any further part in the Proceedings nor in any subsequent proceedings arising out of the Court Settlement Process and no party shall be entitled to call the Settlement Judge as a witness in any subsequent adjudication, arbitration or judicial proceedings arising out of or connected with the Court Settlement Process.\\nExclusion of Liability\\n14. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the Settlement Judge shall have the same immunity from suit in relation to a Court Settlement Process as the Settlement Judge would have if acting otherwise as a Judge in the Proceedings.\\nParticular Directions\\n15. A Court Settlement Conference shall take place on [date] at [place] commencing at [time].\\n16. If by [date] the Parties have not concluded a settlement agreement, the matter shall be listed on the first available date before an appropriate judge who shall be allocated for the future management and trial of the Proceedings.\\n17. The Court Settlement Process shall proceed on the basis of such documents as might be determined at the Preliminary Court Settlement Conference and which may include the documents filed in the court proceedings and further documents critical to the understanding of the issues in the dispute and the positions of the Parties.\\nDated this ...\\nAppendix H: TCC Guidance Note on Procedures for Public Procurement Cases\\nIntroduction\\n1. This protocol provides guidance on the management of public procurement claims. This is a rapidly developing area of law; while this guide should assist, practitioners must ensure that they are aware of the most recent relevant case law.\\n2. Public procurement cases, particularly those involving claims which seek to set aside the decision to award the contract in question, raise singular procedural issues and difficulties. The claimant commonly feels that it has insufficient evidence or documentation fully to particularise its case or otherwise prepare for trial, while the short limitation and mandatory standstill periods mean that proceedings are necessarily issued hastily. The provision of pleadings and documentation on disclosure often gives rise to serious difficulties in connection with confidentiality, particularly where there is a real risk that there will have to be a re-tendering process. Confidentiality rings will often need to be set up by agreement or order.\\n3. The issue and notice of proceedings challenging a contract award decision before the contract has been entered into, results in automatic suspension of the conclusion of the contract with the successful tenderer. The latter has a particular interest in the protection of the confidential information in its documents, many of which will be in the possession of the contracting authority and may wish to make representations in relation to confidentiality and other matters. ${ }^{8}$ It is therefore not unusual for the successful tenderer to make an application to be joined in the proceedings or to have its interests protected by some other means.\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    8 This protocol refers to contracting authorities, but the same issues arise in relation to utilities under the relevant Utilities Contracts Regulations\\nPre-Action Process and ADR\\n4. Given the short limitation period, the time for any pre-action process is limited. As the mandatory standstill period is only 10 days, a potential claimant may need to commence proceedings without delay to obtain automatic suspension of the award of the contract. Whilst a claimant is not bound to comply with the Protocol, it aims to enable parties to settle the issues between them without the need to start proceedings, by encouraging the parties to exchange information about the claim, and to consider using Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to resolve cases before or during proceedings. Litigation should always be a last resort. Therefore, to the extent that this is practical and does not make it unreasonably difficult to issue and serve proceedings within the limitation period, the parties are encouraged to use a pre-action process.\\n5. The pre-action process which is recommended is as follows:\\n1) The potential claimant will send a letter before claim to the contracting authority. This should identify the procurement process to which the claim relates; the grounds then known for the claim (both factual and legal); any information sought from the authority; the remedy required, and any request for an extension of the standstill period and/or a request not to enter into the contract for a specific period of time and/or not to do so without a specified period of notice to the potential claimant. The letter should propose an appropriate, short, time limit for a response.\\n2) The authority should promptly acknowledge receipt of the letter before claim, notify its solicitors' details and (if requested) indicate whether the standstill period will be extended and if so,by how long. The authority should then provide any information to which the claimant may be entitled as soon as possible, and send a substantive response within the timescale proposed by the claimant, or as soon as practical thereafter.\\n3) Having exchanged correspondence and information, the parties should continue to make appropriate and proportionate efforts to resolve the dispute without the need to commence proceedings.\\n6. The parties should act co-operatively and reasonably in dealing with all aspects of the litigation, including requests for extensions of time, taking into account the expiry of the standstill period and/or any limitation periods. The parties should also act co-operatively and reasonably in dealing with all aspects of the litigation, including amendments following further disclosure.\\n7. The parties should also act reasonably and proportionately in providing one another with information, taking into account any genuine concerns with regard to confidentiality, whether their own, or those of third parties. The parties should consider the use of confidentiality rings and undertakings to support resolution of the dispute prior to the issue of proceedings (as to confidentiality rings and undertakings see below). The aim should be to avoid the need to issue proceedings simply to obtain early specific disclosure. The authority is strongly encouraged to disclose the key decision materials at an early stage where relevant to the complaint made. ${ }^{9}$\\n8. ADR processes are encouraged, both before and during proceedings. The Court may order a stay of proceedings, direct a window in the timetable leading up to trial to enable mediation or other ADR to take place, or make an ADR order in the terms of Appendix E (see paragraph 7.3.2) particularly if (due to the claim being or becoming limited to damages) there is less urgency in fixing an early trial date.\\nInstitution of Proceedings\\nService of the Claim Form\\n9. The Claim Form must be served on the Defendant within 7 days after the date of issue, the first day of the 7 being the day following the day on which the Court seals the Claim Form: accordingly, a claim form issued on Wednesday must be served no later than the following Wednesday. \\\"Service\\\" for the purposes of the regulations requires the claimant to complete the step constituting service under CPR 7.5(1) within 7 days of issuing the Claim Form. ${ }^{10}$\\nService of the Particulars of Claim\\n10.

However, if there is uncertainty as to the course the proceedings may take so that it is not possible to prepare a realistic costs budget, or if the speed at which proceedings are being pursued is such that there is insufficient time for the parties to prepare and file sensible costs budgets or to take the steps required in connection with electronic disclosure in time for the CMC fixed by the Court, it is recommended that the claimant apply to the Court in writing, either before or at the same time as applying to fix the CMC, for an urgent order that the parties do not have to serve costs budgets 7 days before the CMC or dis-applying the provisions of 31BPD. 4 in relation to disclosure of electronic documents. Unless one party objects, the Court will deal with such applications on paper.\\nSpecific and Early Disclosure\\n24. Early disclosure may be justified to enable the claimant to plead its case properly or to secure finalised pleadings if and when expedited trials are ordered.\\n25. Contracting authorities are encouraged to provide their key decision making materials at a very early stage of proceedings or during any preaction correspondence. This may include the documentation referred to in Regulation 84 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (\\\"the 2015 Regulations\\\").\\n26. The question of disclosure will be considered at the first CMC. Applications which are likely to be contested should be brought on promptly; early hearings can be fixed if required. The parties' attention is drawn to the general provisions on disclosure in this Guide at Section 11 and to the protocol for e-disclosure prepared by TeCSA of 9 January 2015.\\nConfidentiality generally\\n27. Public procurement claims frequently involve the disclosure of, and reliance upon, confidential information. Confidentiality is not a bar to disclosure. ${ }^{11}$ However, the need to protect confidential information needs to be balanced by the basic principle of open justice. Managing the use of confidential information in the proceedings tends to increase both the cost and complexity of the litigation. The Court will seek to manage the proceedings so that confidentiality is protected where genuinely necessary but ensuring that the issue of confidentiality does not give rise to unnecessary cost or complexity. Assertions of confidentiality should only be made where properly warranted.\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    11 Science Research Council v Nasse [1980] AC 1028\\n28. Once a case has been allocated to a particular TCC judge, papers and communications, particularly those which are to be treated as confidential, should generally be passed through the relevant Judge's Clerk to limit the risk of inadvertent disclosure.\\n29. Papers delivered to and communications with the Court and the Judge's Clerk should be marked as \\\"Confidential\\\" if they are confidential.\\n30. It is recommended that documents containing confidential material are provided on coloured paper so that their confidential status is immediately apparent (practitioners are asked to take care that the print remains legible when printed on a coloured background). Where relevant, the level of confidentiality should be identified either by a stamp or mark (e.g. \\\"Confidential 1st Tier\\\") or by a particular colour of paper. ${ }^{12}$\\n31. Where necessary to protect confidential information the Court may, if requested, make an order restricting inspection of the Court files. Requests to restrict inspection should only be made where necessary. Any member of the public may seek an order from the Court varying any such restrictions. Consideration should be given to providing appropriately redacted pleadings for the Court file so as to permit public access to them. As to the management of confidential information in pleadings generally, see paragraph 11 above.\\nRedactions\\n32. Redaction of disclosed documents, statements or pleadings can be justified on the grounds that the redactions cover privileged and/or confidential material. In the latter case, redactions may be justified to enable documents to be more widely disclosable to people outside any confidentiality rings. In such cases, a schedule should be prepared which explains the justification for the redactions. The schedule should list the information in respect of which confidential treatment is claimed and the reasons for the claim for confidentiality. The schedule should contain two columns: the first giving the relevant page and paragraph reference (a line number should be added if there are a number of pieces of confidential information in one paragraph in the document concerned); and the second setting out the reasons for asserting confidentiality. For example:\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    12 As to the use of tiers in confidentiality rings see paragraphs 41 and 42\\n---\\nDocument Title\\n| Location in Document | Reason for assertion of confidentiality |\\n| :-- | :-- |\\n| Page 15, paragraph\", \"filepath\": \"Section 18.

Ltd. V Central Bedfordshire Borough Council [2015] EWHC 604 (TCC)\\n11. If the Particulars of Claim (or other pleadings) contain confidential information, the party serving the pleading should lodge with the Court (a) a nonconfidential version of the pleading redacted so as to preserve confidential information and (b) an unredacted version marked as confidential and sealed in an envelope also marked as confidential and seek an order by letter, copied to the other party and any relevant third parties, that the access to the Court file be restricted. Wherever possible, confidential information should be contained in a self-contained schedule or annex. Where a pleading is served electronically, the party serving it should ensure that redaction is effective and should give consideration to methods of protecting confidentiality, such as password protection. The continued arrangements to protect confidentiality should be addressed at the first CMC pursuant to paragraph 22 below.\\nJudicial Review\\n12. Sometimes claimants find it necessary to bring proceedings for Judicial Review in the Administrative Court as well as issuing a claim under the Regulations in the TCC. This usually happens where the claimant's right to bring a claim under the Regulations is or may be disputed, but there may be other reasons.\\n13. Where this happens the claim for Judicial Review will, unless otherwise ordered by the Judge in Charge of either the Administrative Court or the TCC, be heard and case managed together with the related claim in the TCC before a TCC judge who is also a designated judge of the Administrative Court.\\n14. In this situation claimants are to take the following steps:\\n1) At the time of issuing the claim form in the Administrative Court the claimant's solicitors are to write to the Administrative Court Office, with a copy to the Judges in Charge of both the Administrative Court and the TCC, to request that the claim be heard alongside the related claim in the TCC.\\n2) The letter is to be clearly marked\\n\\\"URGENT REQUEST FOR THE HEARING OF A PUBLIC PROCUREMENT CLAIM BY A JUDGE OF THE TCC WHO IS A DESIGNATED JUDGE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COURT\\\"\\n3) If they are not notified within 3 days of the issue of the claim form that the papers will be transferred to the TCC, the claimant's solicitors should contact the Administrative Court Office and thereafter keep the TCC informed of the position.\\n15. This procedure is to apply only when claim forms are issued by the same claimant against the same defendant in both the Administrative Court and the TCC almost simultaneously (in other words, within 48 hours of each other, excluding non-working days).\\n16. When the papers are transferred to the TCC by the Administrative Court Office the Judge in Charge of the TCC will review the papers immediately to ensure that it is appropriate for the two claims to be case managed and/or heard together by a judge of the Administrative Court who is also a judge of the TCC.\\n17. The Judge in Charge of the TCC will then notify the claimants and the Administrative Court Office whether or not both claims should proceed in the TCC. If it appears that the claim for Judicial Review should not be heard by a judge of the TCC, the Judge in Charge of the TCC will, after consultation with the Judge in Charge of the Administrative Court, transfer the case back to the Administrative Court and give his/her reasons for doing so.\\n18. If it is directed that the claim for Judicial Review should be heard by a judge of the TCC, the Judge in Charge of the TCC will ensure that the application for permission to apply for Judicial Review is determined at the earliest opportunity by a judge of the TCC who is also a designated judge of the Administrative Court.\\n19. If permission is granted, the claim will be case managed and heard by a TCC judge who is a designated judge of the Administrative Court, save that routine directions may, if it is appropriate and expedient to do so, be given by a judge of the TCC who is not a designated charge of the Administrative Court.\\n20. At all stages of the proceedings the titles of all documents filed in the JR proceedings are to bear the Administrative Court title and case number and are to state that the claim is being heard and managed together with TCC Case No HT-[]-[].\\nCMC\\n21. An early CMC may be appropriate, so that the Court may assess the urgency and fix appropriate dates for trial, specific anticipated applications (such as applications for lifting the statutory suspension, or applications for specific disclosure or expedited trial) and other stages of trial or other matters such as disclosure, witness statements and expert reports (the deployment of expert evidence will require clear justification). Either party may request the Court to fix the first CMC and the Court will endeavour to accommodate such requests.\\n22. The parties should be aware of the pilot scheme for Shorter and Flexible Trial Procedures and Practice Direction 51N and to address their minds to the question of whether either scheme might be appropriate for their case. These issues should be addressed at the first CMC.\\nCost budgeting\\n23. The provisions in the CPR about preparation of costs budgets (CPR Part\", \"filepath\": \"Section 18.

The Court Settlement Process under this Order is a confidential, voluntary and non-binding dispute resolution process in which the Settlement Judge assists the Parties in reaching an amicable settlement at a Court Settlement Conference.\\n2. This Order provides for the process by which the Court assists in the resolution of the disputes in the Proceedings. This Order is made by consent of the Parties with a view to achieving the amicable settlement of such disputes. It is agreed that the Settlement Judge may vary this Order at any time as he thinks appropriate or in accordance with the agreement of the Parties.\\n3. The following definitions shall apply:\\n1) The Parties shall be [names]\\n2) The Proceedings are [identify]\\n3) The Settlement Judge is [name]\\nThe Court Settlement Process\\n4. The Settlement Judge may conduct the Court Settlement Process in such manner, as the Judge considers appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the wishes of the Parties and the overriding objective in Part 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. A Preliminary Court Settlement Conference shall be held, either in person or in some other convenient manner, at which the Parties and the Settlement Judge shall determine, in general terms, the procedure to be adopted for the Court Settlement Process, the venue of the Court Settlement Conference, the estimated duration of the Court Settlement Conference and the material which will be read by the Settlement Judge in advance of the Court Settlement Conference.\\n5. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, during the Court Settlement Conference the Settlement Judge may communicate with the Parties together or with any Party separately, including private meetings at which the Settlement Judge may express views on the disputes. Each Party shall cooperate with the Settlement Judge. A Party may request a private meeting with the Settlement Judge at any time during the Court Settlement Conference. The Parties shall give full assistance to enable the Court Settlement Conference to proceed and be concluded within the time stipulated by the Settlement Judge.\\n6. In advance of the Court Settlement Conference, each Party shall notify the Settlement Judge and the other Party or Parties of the names and the role of all persons involved in the Court Settlement Conference. Each Party shall nominate a person having full authority to settle the disputes.\\n7. No offers or promises or agreements shall have any legal effect unless and until they are included in a written agreement signed by representatives of all Parties (the \\\"Settlement Agreement\\\").\\n8. If the Court Settlement Conference does not lead to a Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Judge may, if requested by the Parties, send the Parties such assessment setting out his views on such matters as the Parties shall request, which may include, for instance, his views on the disputes, his views on prospects of success on individual issues, the likely outcome of the case and what would be an appropriate settlement. Such assessment shall be confidential to the parties and may not be used or referred to in any subsequent proceedings.\\nTermination of the Settlement Process\\n9. The Court Settlement Process shall come to end upon the signing of a Settlement Agreement by the Parties in respect of the disputes or when the Settlement Judge so directs or upon written notification by any Party at any time to the Settlement Judge and the other Party or Parties that the Court Settlement Process is terminated.\\nConfidentiality\\n10. The Court Settlement Process is private and confidential. Every document, communication or other form of information disclosed, made or produced by any Party specifically for the purpose of the Court Settlement Process shall be treated as being disclosed on a privileged and without prejudice basis and no privilege or confidentiality shall be waived by such disclosure.\\n11. Nothing said or done during the course of the Court Settlement Process is intended to or shall in any way affect the rights or prejudice the position of the Parties to the dispute in the Proceedings or any subsequent arbitration, adjudication or litigation. If the Settlement Judge is told by a Party that information is being provided to the Settlement Judge in confidence, the Settlement Judge will not disclose that information to any other Party in the course of the Court Settlement Process or to any other person at any time.\\nCosts\\n12. Unless otherwise agreed, each Party shall bear its own costs and shall share equally the Court costs of the Court Settlement Process.\\nSettlement Judge's Role in Subsequent Proceedings\\n13. The Settlement Judge shall from the date of this Order not take any further part in the Proceedings nor in any subsequent proceedings arising out of the Court Settlement Process and no party shall be entitled to call the Settlement Judge as a witness in any subsequent adjudication, arbitration or judicial proceedings arising out of or connected with the Court Settlement Process.\\nExclusion of Liability\\n14. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the Settlement Judge shall have the same immunity from suit in relation to a Court Settlement Process as the Settlement Judge would have if acting otherwise as a Judge in the Proceedings.\\nParticular Directions\\n15. A Court Settlement Conference shall take place on [date] at [place] commencing at [time].\\n16. If by [date] the Parties have not concluded a settlement agreement, the matter shall be listed on the first available date before an appropriate judge who shall be allocated for the future management and trial of the Proceedings.\\n17. The Court Settlement Process shall proceed on the basis of such documents as might be determined at the Preliminary Court Settlement Conference and which may include the documents filed in the court proceedings and further documents critical to the understanding of the issues in the dispute and the positions of the Parties.\\nDated this ...\\nAppendix H: TCC Guidance Note on Procedures for Public Procurement Cases\\nIntroduction\\n1. This protocol provides guidance on the management of public procurement claims. This is a rapidly developing area of law; while this guide should assist, practitioners must ensure that they are aware of the most recent relevant case law.\\n2. Public procurement cases, particularly those involving claims which seek to set aside the decision to award the contract in question, raise singular procedural issues and difficulties. The claimant commonly feels that it has insufficient evidence or documentation fully to particularise its case or otherwise prepare for trial, while the short limitation and mandatory standstill periods mean that proceedings are necessarily issued hastily. The provision of pleadings and documentation on disclosure often gives rise to serious difficulties in connection with confidentiality, particularly where there is a real risk that there will have to be a re-tendering process. Confidentiality rings will often need to be set up by agreement or order.\\n3. The issue and notice of proceedings challenging a contract award decision before the contract has been entered into, results in automatic suspension of the conclusion of the contract with the successful tenderer. The latter has a particular interest in the protection of the confidential information in its documents, many of which will be in the possession of the contracting authority and may wish to make representations in relation to confidentiality and other matters. ${ }^{8}$ It is therefore not unusual for the successful tenderer to make an application to be joined in the proceedings or to have its interests protected by some other means.\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    8 This protocol refers to contracting authorities, but the same issues arise in relation to utilities under the relevant Utilities Contracts Regulations\\nPre-Action Process and ADR\\n4. Given the short limitation period, the time for any pre-action process is limited. As the mandatory standstill period is only 10 days, a potential claimant may need to commence proceedings without delay to obtain automatic suspension of the award of the contract. Whilst a claimant is not bound to comply with the Protocol, it aims to enable parties to settle the issues between them without the need to start proceedings, by encouraging the parties to exchange information about the claim, and to consider using Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to resolve cases before or during proceedings. Litigation should always be a last resort. Therefore, to the extent that this is practical and does not make it unreasonably difficult to issue and serve proceedings within the limitation period, the parties are encouraged to use a pre-action process.\\n5. The pre-action process which is recommended is as follows:\\n1) The potential claimant will send a letter before claim to the contracting authority. This should identify the procurement process to which the claim relates; the grounds then known for the claim (both factual and legal); any information sought from the authority; the remedy required, and any request for an extension of the standstill period and/or a request not to enter into the contract for a specific period of time and/or not to do so without a specified period of notice to the potential claimant. The letter should propose an appropriate, short, time limit for a response.\\n2) The authority should promptly acknowledge receipt of the letter before claim, notify its solicitors' details and (if requested) indicate whether the standstill period will be extended and if so,by how long. The authority should then provide any information to which the claimant may be entitled as soon as possible, and send a substantive response within the timescale proposed by the claimant, or as soon as practical thereafter.\\n3) Having exchanged correspondence and information, the parties should continue to make appropriate and proportionate efforts to resolve the dispute without the need to commence proceedings.\\n6. The parties should act co-operatively and reasonably in dealing with all aspects of the litigation, including requests for extensions of time, taking into account the expiry of the standstill period and/or any limitation periods. The parties should also act co-operatively and reasonably in dealing with all aspects of the litigation, including amendments following further disclosure.\\n7. The parties should also act reasonably and proportionately in providing one another with information, taking into account any genuine concerns with regard to confidentiality, whether their own, or those of third parties. The parties should consider the use of confidentiality rings and undertakings to support resolution of the dispute prior to the issue of proceedings (as to confidentiality rings and undertakings see below). The aim should be to avoid the need to issue proceedings simply to obtain early specific disclosure. The authority is strongly encouraged to disclose the key decision materials at an early stage where relevant to the complaint made. ${ }^{9}$\\n8. ADR processes are encouraged, both before and during proceedings. The Court may order a stay of proceedings, direct a window in the timetable leading up to trial to enable mediation or other ADR to take place, or make an ADR order in the terms of Appendix E (see paragraph 7.3.2) particularly if (due to the claim being or becoming limited to damages) there is less urgency in fixing an early trial date.\\nInstitution of Proceedings\\nService of the Claim Form\\n9. The Claim Form must be served on the Defendant within 7 days after the date of issue, the first day of the 7 being the day following the day on which the Court seals the Claim Form: accordingly, a claim form issued on Wednesday must be served no later than the following Wednesday. \\\"Service\\\" for the purposes of the regulations requires the claimant to complete the step constituting service under CPR 7.5(1) within 7 days of issuing the Claim Form. ${ }^{10}$\\nService of the Particulars of Claim\\n10. Parties should be aware of the provisions of CPR\\n\\n7.4 (1) and (2), CPR 7.4(2) requires that the Particulars of Claim be served no later than the latest time for serving the Claim Form.\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    9 Roche Diagnostics Limited v the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust [2013] EWHC 933\\n    10 Heron Bros. Ltd. V Central Bedfordshire Borough Council [2015] EWHC 604 (TCC)\\n11. If the Particulars of Claim (or other pleadings) contain confidential information, the party serving the pleading should lodge with the Court (a) a nonconfidential version of the pleading redacted so as to preserve confidential information and (b) an unredacted version marked as confidential and sealed in an envelope also marked as confidential and seek an order by letter, copied to the other party and any relevant third parties, that the access to the Court file be restricted. Wherever possible, confidential information should be contained in a self-contained schedule or annex. Where a pleading is served electronically, the party serving it should ensure that redaction is effective and should give consideration to methods of protecting confidentiality, such as password protection. The continued arrangements to protect confidentiality should be addressed at the first CMC pursuant to paragraph 22 below.\\nJudicial Review\\n12. Sometimes claimants find it necessary to bring proceedings for Judicial Review in the Administrative Court as well as issuing a claim under the Regulations in the TCC. This usually happens where the claimant's right to bring a claim under the Regulations is or may be disputed, but there may be other reasons.\\n13. Where this happens the claim for Judicial Review will, unless otherwise ordered by the Judge in Charge of either the Administrative Court or the TCC, be heard and case managed together with the related claim in the TCC before a TCC judge who is also a designated judge of the Administrative Court.\\n14. In this situation claimants are to take the following steps:\\n1) At the time of issuing the claim form in the Administrative Court the claimant's solicitors are to write to the Administrative Court Office, with a copy to the Judges in Charge of both the Administrative Court and the TCC, to request that the claim be heard alongside the related claim in the TCC.\\n2) The letter is to be clearly marked\\n\\\"URGENT REQUEST FOR THE HEARING OF A PUBLIC PROCUREMENT CLAIM BY A JUDGE OF THE TCC WHO IS A DESIGNATED JUDGE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COURT\\\"\\n3) If they are not notified within 3 days of the issue of the claim form that the papers will be transferred to the TCC, the claimant's solicitors should contact the Administrative Court Office and thereafter keep the TCC informed of the position.\\n15. This procedure is to apply only when claim forms are issued by the same claimant against the same defendant in both the Administrative Court and the TCC almost simultaneously (in other words, within 48 hours of each other, excluding non-working days).\\n16. When the papers are transferred to the TCC by the Administrative Court Office the Judge in Charge of the TCC will review the papers immediately to ensure that it is appropriate for the two claims to be case managed and/or heard together by a judge of the Administrative Court who is also a judge of the TCC.\\n17. The Judge in Charge of the TCC will then notify the claimants and the Administrative Court Office whether or not both claims should proceed in the TCC. If it appears that the claim for Judicial Review should not be heard by a judge of the TCC, the Judge in Charge of the TCC will, after consultation with the Judge in Charge of the Administrative Court, transfer the case back to the Administrative Court and give his/her reasons for doing so.\\n18. If it is directed that the claim for Judicial Review should be heard by a judge of the TCC, the Judge in Charge of the TCC will ensure that the application for permission to apply for Judicial Review is determined at the earliest opportunity by a judge of the TCC who is also a designated judge of the Administrative Court.\\n19. If permission is granted, the claim will be case managed and heard by a TCC judge who is a designated judge of the Administrative Court, save that routine directions may, if it is appropriate and expedient to do so, be given by a judge of the TCC who is not a designated charge of the Administrative Court.\\n20. At all stages of the proceedings the titles of all documents filed in the JR proceedings are to bear the Administrative Court title and case number and are to state that the claim is being heard and managed together with TCC Case No HT-[]-[].\\nCMC\\n21. An early CMC may be appropriate, so that the Court may assess the urgency and fix appropriate dates for trial, specific anticipated applications (such as applications for lifting the statutory suspension, or applications for specific disclosure or expedited trial) and other stages of trial or other matters such as disclosure, witness statements and expert reports (the deployment of expert evidence will require clear justification). Either party may request the Court to fix the first CMC and the Court will endeavour to accommodate such requests.\\n22. The parties should be aware of the pilot scheme for Shorter and Flexible Trial Procedures and Practice Direction 51N and to address their minds to the question of whether either scheme might be appropriate for their case. These issues should be addressed at the first CMC.\\nCost budgeting\\n23. The provisions in the CPR about preparation of costs budgets (CPR Part\\n\\n3.13 and Practice Direction 3E) and electronic disclosure (Practice Direction 31B) apply. However, if there is uncertainty as to the course the proceedings may take so that it is not possible to prepare a realistic costs budget, or if the speed at which proceedings are being pursued is such that there is insufficient time for the parties to prepare and file sensible costs budgets or to take the steps required in connection with electronic disclosure in time for the CMC fixed by the Court, it is recommended that the claimant apply to the Court in writing, either before or at the same time as applying to fix the CMC, for an urgent order that the parties do not have to serve costs budgets 7 days before the CMC or dis-applying the provisions of 31BPD. 4 in relation to disclosure of electronic documents. Unless one party objects, the Court will deal with such applications on paper.\\nSpecific and Early Disclosure\\n24. Early disclosure may be justified to enable the claimant to plead its case properly or to secure finalised pleadings if and when expedited trials are ordered.\\n25. Contracting authorities are encouraged to provide their key decision making materials at a very early stage of proceedings or during any preaction correspondence. This may include the documentation referred to in Regulation 84 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (\\\"the 2015 Regulations\\\").\\n26. The question of disclosure will be considered at the first CMC. Applications which are likely to be contested should be brought on promptly; early hearings can be fixed if required. The parties' attention is drawn to the general provisions on disclosure in this Guide at Section 11 and to the protocol for e-disclosure prepared by TeCSA of 9 January 2015.\\nConfidentiality generally\\n27. Public procurement claims frequently involve the disclosure of, and reliance upon, confidential information. Confidentiality is not a bar to disclosure. ${ }^{11}$ However, the need to protect confidential information needs to be balanced by the basic principle of open justice. Managing the use of confidential information in the proceedings tends to increase both the cost and complexity of the litigation. The Court will seek to manage the proceedings so that confidentiality is protected where genuinely necessary but ensuring that the issue of confidentiality does not give rise to unnecessary cost or complexity. Assertions of confidentiality should only be made where properly warranted.\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    11 Science Research Council v Nasse [1980] AC 1028\\n28. Once a case has been allocated to a particular TCC judge, papers and communications, particularly those which are to be treated as confidential, should generally be passed through the relevant Judge's Clerk to limit the risk of inadvertent disclosure.\\n29. Papers delivered to and communications with the Court and the Judge's Clerk should be marked as \\\"Confidential\\\" if they are confidential.\\n30. It is recommended that documents containing confidential material are provided on coloured paper so that their confidential status is immediately apparent (practitioners are asked to take care that the print remains legible when printed on a coloured background). Where relevant, the level of confidentiality should be identified either by a stamp or mark (e.g. \\\"Confidential 1st Tier\\\") or by a particular colour of paper. ${ }^{12}$\\n31. Where necessary to protect confidential information the Court may, if requested, make an order restricting inspection of the Court files. Requests to restrict inspection should only be made where necessary. Any member of the public may seek an order from the Court varying any such restrictions. Consideration should be given to providing appropriately redacted pleadings for the Court file so as to permit public access to them. As to the management of confidential information in pleadings generally, see paragraph 11 above.\\nRedactions\\n32. Redaction of disclosed documents, statements or pleadings can be justified on the grounds that the redactions cover privileged and/or confidential material. In the latter case, redactions may be justified to enable documents to be more widely disclosable to people outside any confidentiality rings. In such cases, a schedule should be prepared which explains the justification for the redactions. The schedule should list the information in respect of which confidential treatment is claimed and the reasons for the claim for confidentiality. The schedule should contain two columns: the first giving the relevant page and paragraph reference (a line number should be added if there are a number of pieces of confidential information in one paragraph in the document concerned); and the second setting out the reasons for asserting confidentiality. For example:\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    12 As to the use of tiers in confidentiality rings see paragraphs 41 and 42\\n---\\nDocument Title\\n| Location in Document | Reason for assertion of confidentiality |\\n| :-- | :-- |\\n| Page 15, paragraph\", \"groups\": [], \"id\": \"section_18_the_tcc_judge_as_arbitrator_182_arbitration_management_and_fees_p_111_chunk_2\", \"oids\": [], \"reranker_score\": 1.7341481447219849, \"score\": 0.024924011901021004, \"search_agent_query\": \"\", \"sourcefile\": \"Technology and Construction Court Guide\", \"sourcepage\": \"Section 18.

The Court Settlement Process under this Order is a confidential, voluntary and non-binding dispute resolution process in which the Settlement Judge assists the Parties in reaching an amicable settlement at a Court Settlement Conference.\\n2. This Order provides for the process by which the Court assists in the resolution of the disputes in the Proceedings. This Order is made by consent of the Parties with a view to achieving the amicable settlement of such disputes. It is agreed that the Settlement Judge may vary this Order at any time as he thinks appropriate or in accordance with the agreement of the Parties.\\n3. The following definitions shall apply:\\n1) The Parties shall be [names]\\n2) The Proceedings are [identify]\\n3) The Settlement Judge is [name]\\nThe Court Settlement Process\\n4. The Settlement Judge may conduct the Court Settlement Process in such manner, as the Judge considers appropriate, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the wishes of the Parties and the overriding objective in Part 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. A Preliminary Court Settlement Conference shall be held, either in person or in some other convenient manner, at which the Parties and the Settlement Judge shall determine, in general terms, the procedure to be adopted for the Court Settlement Process, the venue of the Court Settlement Conference, the estimated duration of the Court Settlement Conference and the material which will be read by the Settlement Judge in advance of the Court Settlement Conference.\\n5. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, during the Court Settlement Conference the Settlement Judge may communicate with the Parties together or with any Party separately, including private meetings at which the Settlement Judge may express views on the disputes. Each Party shall cooperate with the Settlement Judge. A Party may request a private meeting with the Settlement Judge at any time during the Court Settlement Conference. The Parties shall give full assistance to enable the Court Settlement Conference to proceed and be concluded within the time stipulated by the Settlement Judge.\\n6. In advance of the Court Settlement Conference, each Party shall notify the Settlement Judge and the other Party or Parties of the names and the role of all persons involved in the Court Settlement Conference. Each Party shall nominate a person having full authority to settle the disputes.\\n7. No offers or promises or agreements shall have any legal effect unless and until they are included in a written agreement signed by representatives of all Parties (the \\\"Settlement Agreement\\\").\\n8. If the Court Settlement Conference does not lead to a Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Judge may, if requested by the Parties, send the Parties such assessment setting out his views on such matters as the Parties shall request, which may include, for instance, his views on the disputes, his views on prospects of success on individual issues, the likely outcome of the case and what would be an appropriate settlement. Such assessment shall be confidential to the parties and may not be used or referred to in any subsequent proceedings.\\nTermination of the Settlement Process\\n9. The Court Settlement Process shall come to end upon the signing of a Settlement Agreement by the Parties in respect of the disputes or when the Settlement Judge so directs or upon written notification by any Party at any time to the Settlement Judge and the other Party or Parties that the Court Settlement Process is terminated.\\nConfidentiality\\n10. The Court Settlement Process is private and confidential. Every document, communication or other form of information disclosed, made or produced by any Party specifically for the purpose of the Court Settlement Process shall be treated as being disclosed on a privileged and without prejudice basis and no privilege or confidentiality shall be waived by such disclosure.\\n11. Nothing said or done during the course of the Court Settlement Process is intended to or shall in any way affect the rights or prejudice the position of the Parties to the dispute in the Proceedings or any subsequent arbitration, adjudication or litigation. If the Settlement Judge is told by a Party that information is being provided to the Settlement Judge in confidence, the Settlement Judge will not disclose that information to any other Party in the course of the Court Settlement Process or to any other person at any time.\\nCosts\\n12. Unless otherwise agreed, each Party shall bear its own costs and shall share equally the Court costs of the Court Settlement Process.\\nSettlement Judge's Role in Subsequent Proceedings\\n13. The Settlement Judge shall from the date of this Order not take any further part in the Proceedings nor in any subsequent proceedings arising out of the Court Settlement Process and no party shall be entitled to call the Settlement Judge as a witness in any subsequent adjudication, arbitration or judicial proceedings arising out of or connected with the Court Settlement Process.\\nExclusion of Liability\\n14. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the Settlement Judge shall have the same immunity from suit in relation to a Court Settlement Process as the Settlement Judge would have if acting otherwise as a Judge in the Proceedings.\\nParticular Directions\\n15. A Court Settlement Conference shall take place on [date] at [place] commencing at [time].\\n16. If by [date] the Parties have not concluded a settlement agreement, the matter shall be listed on the first available date before an appropriate judge who shall be allocated for the future management and trial of the Proceedings.\\n17. The Court Settlement Process shall proceed on the basis of such documents as might be determined at the Preliminary Court Settlement Conference and which may include the documents filed in the court proceedings and further documents critical to the understanding of the issues in the dispute and the positions of the Parties.\\nDated this ...\\nAppendix H: TCC Guidance Note on Procedures for Public Procurement Cases\\nIntroduction\\n1. This protocol provides guidance on the management of public procurement claims. This is a rapidly developing area of law; while this guide should assist, practitioners must ensure that they are aware of the most recent relevant case law.\\n2. Public procurement cases, particularly those involving claims which seek to set aside the decision to award the contract in question, raise singular procedural issues and difficulties. The claimant commonly feels that it has insufficient evidence or documentation fully to particularise its case or otherwise prepare for trial, while the short limitation and mandatory standstill periods mean that proceedings are necessarily issued hastily. The provision of pleadings and documentation on disclosure often gives rise to serious difficulties in connection with confidentiality, particularly where there is a real risk that there will have to be a re-tendering process. Confidentiality rings will often need to be set up by agreement or order.\\n3. The issue and notice of proceedings challenging a contract award decision before the contract has been entered into, results in automatic suspension of the conclusion of the contract with the successful tenderer. The latter has a particular interest in the protection of the confidential information in its documents, many of which will be in the possession of the contracting authority and may wish to make representations in relation to confidentiality and other matters. ${ }^{8}$ It is therefore not unusual for the successful tenderer to make an application to be joined in the proceedings or to have its interests protected by some other means.\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    8 This protocol refers to contracting authorities, but the same issues arise in relation to utilities under the relevant Utilities Contracts Regulations\\nPre-Action Process and ADR\\n4. Given the short limitation period, the time for any pre-action process is limited. As the mandatory standstill period is only 10 days, a potential claimant may need to commence proceedings without delay to obtain automatic suspension of the award of the contract. Whilst a claimant is not bound to comply with the Protocol, it aims to enable parties to settle the issues between them without the need to start proceedings, by encouraging the parties to exchange information about the claim, and to consider using Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to resolve cases before or during proceedings. Litigation should always be a last resort. Therefore, to the extent that this is practical and does not make it unreasonably difficult to issue and serve proceedings within the limitation period, the parties are encouraged to use a pre-action process.\\n5. The pre-action process which is recommended is as follows:\\n1) The potential claimant will send a letter before claim to the contracting authority. This should identify the procurement process to which the claim relates; the grounds then known for the claim (both factual and legal); any information sought from the authority; the remedy required, and any request for an extension of the standstill period and/or a request not to enter into the contract for a specific period of time and/or not to do so without a specified period of notice to the potential claimant. The letter should propose an appropriate, short, time limit for a response.\\n2) The authority should promptly acknowledge receipt of the letter before claim, notify its solicitors' details and (if requested) indicate whether the standstill period will be extended and if so,by how long. The authority should then provide any information to which the claimant may be entitled as soon as possible, and send a substantive response within the timescale proposed by the claimant, or as soon as practical thereafter.\\n3) Having exchanged correspondence and information, the parties should continue to make appropriate and proportionate efforts to resolve the dispute without the need to commence proceedings.\\n6. The parties should act co-operatively and reasonably in dealing with all aspects of the litigation, including requests for extensions of time, taking into account the expiry of the standstill period and/or any limitation periods. The parties should also act co-operatively and reasonably in dealing with all aspects of the litigation, including amendments following further disclosure.\\n7. The parties should also act reasonably and proportionately in providing one another with information, taking into account any genuine concerns with regard to confidentiality, whether their own, or those of third parties. The parties should consider the use of confidentiality rings and undertakings to support resolution of the dispute prior to the issue of proceedings (as to confidentiality rings and undertakings see below). The aim should be to avoid the need to issue proceedings simply to obtain early specific disclosure. The authority is strongly encouraged to disclose the key decision materials at an early stage where relevant to the complaint made. ${ }^{9}$\\n8. ADR processes are encouraged, both before and during proceedings. The Court may order a stay of proceedings, direct a window in the timetable leading up to trial to enable mediation or other ADR to take place, or make an ADR order in the terms of Appendix E (see paragraph 7.3.2) particularly if (due to the claim being or becoming limited to damages) there is less urgency in fixing an early trial date.\\nInstitution of Proceedings\\nService of the Claim Form\\n9. The Claim Form must be served on the Defendant within 7 days after the date of issue, the first day of the 7 being the day following the day on which the Court seals the Claim Form: accordingly, a claim form issued on Wednesday must be served no later than the following Wednesday. \\\"Service\\\" for the purposes of the regulations requires the claimant to complete the step constituting service under CPR 7.5(1) within 7 days of issuing the Claim Form. ${ }^{10}$\\nService of the Particulars of Claim\\n10. Parties should be aware of the provisions of CPR\\n[4]: 3.13 and Practice Direction 3E) and electronic disclosure (Practice Direction 31B) apply. However, if there is uncertainty as to the course the proceedings may take so that it is not possible to prepare a realistic costs budget, or if the speed at which proceedings are being pursued is such that there is insufficient time for the parties to prepare and file sensible costs budgets or to take the steps required in connection with electronic disclosure in time for the CMC fixed by the Court, it is recommended that the claimant apply to the Court in writing, either before or at the same time as applying to fix the CMC, for an urgent order that the parties do not have to serve costs budgets 7 days before the CMC or dis-applying the provisions of 31BPD. 4 in relation to disclosure of electronic documents. Unless one party objects, the Court will deal with such applications on paper.\\nSpecific and Early Disclosure\\n24. Early disclosure may be justified to enable the claimant to plead its case properly or to secure finalised pleadings if and when expedited trials are ordered.\\n25. Contracting authorities are encouraged to provide their key decision making materials at a very early stage of proceedings or during any preaction correspondence. This may include the documentation referred to in Regulation 84 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (\\\"the 2015 Regulations\\\").\\n26. The question of disclosure will be considered at the first CMC. Applications which are likely to be contested should be brought on promptly; early hearings can be fixed if required. The parties' attention is drawn to the general provisions on disclosure in this Guide at Section 11 and to the protocol for e-disclosure prepared by TeCSA of 9 January 2015.\\nConfidentiality generally\\n27. Public procurement claims frequently involve the disclosure of, and reliance upon, confidential information. Confidentiality is not a bar to disclosure. ${ }^{11}$ However, the need to protect confidential information needs to be balanced by the basic principle of open justice. Managing the use of confidential information in the proceedings tends to increase both the cost and complexity of the litigation. The Court will seek to manage the proceedings so that confidentiality is protected where genuinely necessary but ensuring that the issue of confidentiality does not give rise to unnecessary cost or complexity. Assertions of confidentiality should only be made where properly warranted.\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    11 Science Research Council v Nasse [1980] AC 1028\\n28. Once a case has been allocated to a particular TCC judge, papers and communications, particularly those which are to be treated as confidential, should generally be passed through the relevant Judge's Clerk to limit the risk of inadvertent disclosure.\\n29. Papers delivered to and communications with the Court and the Judge's Clerk should be marked as \\\"Confidential\\\" if they are confidential.\\n30. It is recommended that documents containing confidential material are provided on coloured paper so that their confidential status is immediately apparent (practitioners are asked to take care that the print remains legible when printed on a coloured background). Where relevant, the level of confidentiality should be identified either by a stamp or mark (e.g. \\\"Confidential 1st Tier\\\") or by a particular colour of paper. ${ }^{12}$\\n31. Where necessary to protect confidential information the Court may, if requested, make an order restricting inspection of the Court files. Requests to restrict inspection should only be made where necessary. Any member of the public may seek an order from the Court varying any such restrictions. Consideration should be given to providing appropriately redacted pleadings for the Court file so as to permit public access to them. As to the management of confidential information in pleadings generally, see paragraph 11 above.\\nRedactions\\n32. Redaction of disclosed documents, statements or pleadings can be justified on the grounds that the redactions cover privileged and/or confidential material. In the latter case, redactions may be justified to enable documents to be more widely disclosable to people outside any confidentiality rings. In such cases, a schedule should be prepared which explains the justification for the redactions. The schedule should list the information in respect of which confidential treatment is claimed and the reasons for the claim for confidentiality. The schedule should contain two columns: the first giving the relevant page and paragraph reference (a line number should be added if there are a number of pieces of confidential information in one paragraph in the document concerned); and the second setting out the reasons for asserting confidentiality. For example:\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    12 As to the use of tiers in confidentiality rings see paragraphs 41 and 42\\n---\\nDocument Title\\n| Location in Document | Reason for assertion of confidentiality |\\n| :-- | :-- |\\n| Page 15, paragraph\\n[5]: 7.4 (1) and (2), CPR 7.4(2) requires that the Particulars of Claim be served no later than the latest time for serving the Claim Form.\\n[^0]\\n[^0]:    9 Roche Diagnostics Limited v the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust [2013] EWHC 933\\n    10 Heron Bros. Ltd. V Central Bedfordshire Borough Council [2015] EWHC 604 (TCC)\\n11. If the Particulars of Claim (or other pleadings) contain confidential information, the party serving the pleading should lodge with the Court (a) a nonconfidential version of the pleading redacted so as to preserve confidential information and (b) an unredacted version marked as confidential and sealed in an envelope also marked as confidential and seek an order by letter, copied to the other party and any relevant third parties, that the access to the Court file be restricted. Wherever possible, confidential information should be contained in a self-contained schedule or annex. Where a pleading is served electronically, the party serving it should ensure that redaction is effective and should give consideration to methods of protecting confidentiality, such as password protection. The continued arrangements to protect confidentiality should be addressed at the first CMC pursuant to paragraph 22 below.\\nJudicial Review\\n12. Sometimes claimants find it necessary to bring proceedings for Judicial Review in the Administrative Court as well as issuing a claim under the Regulations in the TCC. This usually happens where the claimant's right to bring a claim under the Regulations is or may be disputed, but there may be other reasons.\\n13. Where this happens the claim for Judicial Review will, unless otherwise ordered by the Judge in Charge of either the Administrative Court or the TCC, be heard and case managed together with the related claim in the TCC before a TCC judge who is also a designated judge of the Administrative Court.\\n14. In this situation claimants are to take the following steps:\\n1) At the time of issuing the claim form in the Administrative Court the claimant's solicitors are to write to the Administrative Court Office, with a copy to the Judges in Charge of both the Administrative Court and the TCC, to request that the claim be heard alongside the related claim in the TCC.\\n2) The letter is to be clearly marked\\n\\\"URGENT REQUEST FOR THE HEARING OF A PUBLIC PROCUREMENT CLAIM BY A JUDGE OF THE TCC WHO IS A DESIGNATED JUDGE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COURT\\\"\\n3) If they are not notified within 3 days of the issue of the claim form that the papers will be transferred to the TCC, the claimant's solicitors should contact the Administrative Court Office and thereafter keep the TCC informed of the position.\\n15. This procedure is to apply only when claim forms are issued by the same claimant against the same defendant in both the Administrative Court and the TCC almost simultaneously (in other words, within 48 hours of each other, excluding non-working days).\\n16. When the papers are transferred to the TCC by the Administrative Court Office the Judge in Charge of the TCC will review the papers immediately to ensure that it is appropriate for the two claims to be case managed and/or heard together by a judge of the Administrative Court who is also a judge of the TCC.\\n17. The Judge in Charge of the TCC will then notify the claimants and the Administrative Court Office whether or not both claims should proceed in the TCC. If it appears that the claim for Judicial Review should not be heard by a judge of the TCC, the Judge in Charge of the TCC will, after consultation with the Judge in Charge of the Administrative Court, transfer the case back to the Administrative Court and give his/her reasons for doing so.\\n18. If it is directed that the claim for Judicial Review should be heard by a judge of the TCC, the Judge in Charge of the TCC will ensure that the application for permission to apply for Judicial Review is determined at the earliest opportunity by a judge of the TCC who is also a designated judge of the Administrative Court.\\n19. If permission is granted, the claim will be case managed and heard by a TCC judge who is a designated judge of the Administrative Court, save that routine directions may, if it is appropriate and expedient to do so, be given by a judge of the TCC who is not a designated charge of the Administrative Court.\\n20. At all stages of the proceedings the titles of all documents filed in the JR proceedings are to bear the Administrative Court title and case number and are to state that the claim is being heard and managed together with TCC Case No HT-[]-[].\\nCMC\\n21. An early CMC may be appropriate, so that the Court may assess the urgency and fix appropriate dates for trial, specific anticipated applications (such as applications for lifting the statutory suspension, or applications for specific disclosure or expedited trial) and other stages of trial or other matters such as disclosure, witness statements and expert reports (the deployment of expert evidence will require clear justification). Either party may request the Court to fix the first CMC and the Court will endeavour to accommodate such requests.\\n22. The parties should be aware of the pilot scheme for Shorter and Flexible Trial Procedures and Practice Direction 51N and to address their minds to the question of whether either scheme might be appropriate for their case. These issues should be addressed at the first CMC.\\nCost budgeting\\n23.

The rules of practice and procedure apply to litigants in person in the same way as represented parties. The provisions of this guide also apply to litigants in person. The Court will have regard to the fact a party is unrepresented (see CPR3.1A) but it will not usually apply a lower standard of compliance with rules, PDs or orders of the court (see Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] UKSC 12:)\\n\\n2.2 Basic practical information about bringing a case to court can be found on the government website: King's Bench Division: bring a case to the court GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).\\n\\n2.3 Represented parties must treat litigants in person with consideration and respect at all times during the conduct of the litigation. Similarly, litigants in person must show consideration and respect to their opponents, whether legally represented or not, and to the court.\\n\\n2.4 A litigant in person must give an address for service in England or Wales. If they are a claimant, the address will be required in the claim form or other document by which the proceedings are started. If they are a defendant, it will be in the acknowledgment of service form which must be sent to the court. It is essential that any change of address is notified in writing to the Central Office and to all other parties to the case, otherwise important communications such as notices of hearing dates may not reach the relevant person (although they are likely to be treated as having done so).\\n\\n2.5 The public is entitled to obtain copies of some of the documents that parties file at court unless the court has ordered otherwise. Please see further sections within this guide on online public search, open justice, anonymity, confidential documents, non disclosure orders and Tomlin orders and see CPR5.4B and 5.4C and PD5A.\\n\\n2.6 It is the duty of all parties to litigation, whether represented or not, to bring relevant matters to the attention of the court and not to mislead the court. This means for example that they must not misrepresent the law and must therefore inform the court of any relevant legislation or previous court decisions which are applicable to their case and of which they are aware (whether favourable or not to their case); and must draw the court's attention to any relevant irregularity.\\n\\n2.7 In addition, there is a particular duty when an application is made to the court without the other party being present (for example in the case of urgency or when seeing a judge at an 'Application without Notice'). Here the litigant is under a duty to disclose any facts or other matters (including arguments of fact or of law) which might be relevant to the court's decision, even if adverse to their case, and specifically draw the court's attention to such matters.\\n\\n2.8 In many cases the parties will need legal assistance, whether by way of advice, drafting, representation at hearings or otherwise. It is not the function of court staff to give legal advice; however, subject to that, they will do their best to assist any litigant. Judges are not in a position to give advice about the conduct of a claim\\n\\n2.9 There is general information available to litigants in person on the judiciary website here: Advice for Litigants in Person - Courts and Tribunals Judiciary\\n\\n2.10 The following is a non-exhaustive list of sources of assistance to litigants in person.\\n\\n2.11 Litigants in person who are enquiring as to the possibility of obtaining legal assistance or representation through legal aid may contact Civil Legal Advice at 03453454345 ( 9.00 am to 8.00 pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays) or on the website at https://www.gov.uk/civil-legal-advice. In general, while the availability of legal aid has become very restricted under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicants will probably be directed to pursue their enquiries via firms of solicitors practising in areas of legal aid.\\n\\n2.12 An online service which provides practical information on rights and the law in England and Wales. https://www.advicenow.org.uk/\\n\\n2.13 There is an RCJ Advice Bureau off the Main Hall at the RCJ. The Bureau runs an appointment-based service. To request an appointment, applicants should complete the civil triage form available on their website (www. rcjadvice.org.uk) and email it to them at civiltriage@rcjadvice.org or call into the office to complete the form between 9.30am and 1pm and 2pm and 4.30pm weekdays. Their website has details on all their services and how to access them (www.rcjadvice.org.uk)\\n\\n2.14 Support Through Court (previously known as The Personal Support Unit (PSU)) is an independent charity which supports litigants in person, witnesses, victims, their family members and other supporters attending the Royal Courts of Justice and other courts across the country. Requests vary from the very simple to the complex. Some people just require directions or advice about procedures. Others need to unburden themselves, while others request the moral and emotional support of being accompanied in court. STC can be particularly helpful for clients with special needs.\\n\\n2.15 The volunteers are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice or representation. They can provide procedural information, help to organise and complete paperwork, look up relevant information and discuss settling issues without going to court. They can help before hearings by helping litigants put their thoughts in order, provide emotional support in court and make sure the litigant understands what was discussed in the hearing and the next steps.\\n\\n2.16 The office in the RCJ is open Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 4 pm (closed for lunch between 1 and 1.45 pm ). Walk-ins are accepted subject to availability. Face-to-face and remote appointments can be booked in advance: https://www.supportthroughcourt.org/locations/ london/rcj-appointment/.\\n\\n2.17 Support for general enquiries is available on 02045205959 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 12.30pm.\\n\\n2.18 Its address is: Thomas Moore Building (ground floor), Royal Courts of Justice, Strand WC2A 2LL. Tel: 02045205959.\\n\\n2.19 There are charities through which qualified Lawyers provide advice without charge (known as \\\"pro bono\\\") for some cases. See https://www.lawworks. org.uk/ and https://weareadvocate.org.uk/.\\n\\n2.20 Advocate is the national pro bono charity of the Bar. They find barristers for people in England and Wales who are not eligible for legal aid and cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. They help with: Specialist legal advice, drafting and representation and help at mediation. Advocate works exclusively with barristers and, as such, can only consider cases that are appropriate for barrister assistance. In essence this means that it would need to be representation in a court or Tribunal in England or Wales or advice or drafting suitable for a barrister to provide. In practice this means different things for different areas of law. Applicants should visit www.weareadvocate. org.uk for information about how to apply.\\n\\n2.21 Barristers who are qualified to work under the direct access scheme can be contacted directly by litigants. This is not a free legal advice scheme but enables litigants to instruct a barrister directly to assist them for example with a court hearing. Further details can be found through the Bar Council direct access portal: Homepage (directaccessportal.co.uk)\\n\\n2.22 Hearings are dealt with more fully in Section 9 below, to which reference should be made. See in particular 9.88-9.89 about contacting the court in advance of any hearings if assistance is required to access the court due to disability or other vulnerability of a party or witness.\\n\\n2.23 Ordinarily, the claimant or applicant is asked to put together an indexed and paginated file of the relevant documents for the court for the purposes of the hearing (called hearing bundles). Where a claimant or applicant is unrepresented, a represented defendant or respondent may be directed to provide the hearing bundles. Parties often file at court, and serve on the other parties, skeleton arguments (written summaries of their arguments and submissions) before a hearing.\\n\\n2.24 Litigants in person should identify in advance of any hearing those points which they consider to be their strongest points, and they should put those points first in their oral and any written submissions to the court.\\n\\n2.25 Before a hearing starts a litigant in person should be given by any other party, and should provide to other parties, photocopies of any legal authorities (past judicial decisions and/or statutes and/or textbooks) which are to be cited to the court in addition to any skeleton argument(s). These should be provided well before the hearing rather than at the door of the court.\\n\\n2.26 In drafting proposed or actual case management directions the parties and the court should make use of any relevant standard directions (which can be found online at http://www.justice.gov.uk//courts/procedure-rules/civil) and adapt them to the circumstances of the case.\\n\\n2.27 Any legal representative in the case should ask the litigant in person to give their name (and to give details of any special arrangements that they may wish to request e.g. in consequence of any disability) to the usher or in-court support staff if they have not already done so.\\n\\n2.28 Proper allowances in relation to hearings will be made in recognition of the difficulties facing litigants in person. The court will aim to enable the unrepresented party's case to be put forward in a way which ensures that the proceedings are conducted fairly.\\n\\n2.29 Where a litigant in person is the applicant, the court may ask one of the represented parties to speak first in court and explain the case briefly and impartially, and to summarise the issues.\\n\\n2.30 The Judge may ask a litigant in person the matters about which their witness may be able to give evidence or on which a witness called by another party ought to be cross-examined, and if necessary put to the witness such questions as the court considers proper.\\n\\n2.31 If a litigant in person wishes to give oral evidence he or she will generally be required to do so from the witness box in the same manner as any other witness of fact.\\n\\n2.32 At the end of the hearing, the judge will explain the Order they make. Representatives for other parties should also explain the court's order after the hearing if the litigant in person does not appear to understand it.\\n\\n2.33 A litigant in person may be assisted at any hearing by an unqualified person (often referred to as a McKenzie friend) subject to the discretion of the court. The Court will generally consider a request by the litigant in person to have a McKenzie friend in accordance with the Guidance in Practice Note (McKenzie friends: Civil and Family Courts) [2010] 1 WLR 1881.\\n\\n2.34 There is a presumption that a McKenzie friend should be permitted but the Guidance gives various examples of reasons as to why they might not. Different considerations may apply where the person seeking the right of audience is being paid or remunerated to do so and litigants in person applying to have a McKenzie friend should be prepared to disclose whether the McKenzie friend is being paid or remunerated and if so how the pay or remuneration is calculated.\\n\\n2.35 The following is a summary of the requirements for the assistance of a McKenzie Friend:\\n\\n2.36 The court may stop a McKenzie Friend from assisting if the court believes there is good reason to do so in any individual case. If the court considers that a person is abusing the right to be a McKenzie Friend (for example, by attending in numerous claims to the detriment of the litigant(s) and/or the court) and this abuse amounts to an interference with the proper processes of the administration of justice, the court may make an order restricting or preventing a person from acting as a McKenzie Friend.\\n\\n2.37 If a person has been declared a vexatious litigant or has a civil restraint order against them, they are unlikely to be given permission to act as a McKenzie Friend.

The rules of practice and procedure apply to litigants in person in the same way as represented parties. The provisions of this guide also apply to litigants in person. The Court will have regard to the fact a party is unrepresented (see CPR3.1A) but it will not usually apply a lower standard of compliance with rules, PDs or orders of the court (see Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] UKSC 12:)\\n[23]: 2.2 Basic practical information about bringing a case to court can be found on the government website: King's Bench Division: bring a case to the court GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).\\n[24]: 2.3 Represented parties must treat litigants in person with consideration and respect at all times during the conduct of the litigation. Similarly, litigants in person must show consideration and respect to their opponents, whether legally represented or not, and to the court.\\n[25]: 2.4 A litigant in person must give an address for service in England or Wales. If they are a claimant, the address will be required in the claim form or other document by which the proceedings are started. If they are a defendant, it will be in the acknowledgment of service form which must be sent to the court. It is essential that any change of address is notified in writing to the Central Office and to all other parties to the case, otherwise important communications such as notices of hearing dates may not reach the relevant person (although they are likely to be treated as having done so).\\n[26]: 2.5 The public is entitled to obtain copies of some of the documents that parties file at court unless the court has ordered otherwise. Please see further sections within this guide on online public search, open justice, anonymity, confidential documents, non disclosure orders and Tomlin orders and see CPR5.4B and 5.4C and PD5A.\\n[27]: 2.6 It is the duty of all parties to litigation, whether represented or not, to bring relevant matters to the attention of the court and not to mislead the court. This means for example that they must not misrepresent the law and must therefore inform the court of any relevant legislation or previous court decisions which are applicable to their case and of which they are aware (whether favourable or not to their case); and must draw the court's attention to any relevant irregularity.\\n[28]: 2.7 In addition, there is a particular duty when an application is made to the court without the other party being present (for example in the case of urgency or when seeing a judge at an 'Application without Notice'). Here the litigant is under a duty to disclose any facts or other matters (including arguments of fact or of law) which might be relevant to the court's decision, even if adverse to their case, and specifically draw the court's attention to such matters.\\n[29]: 2.8 In many cases the parties will need legal assistance, whether by way of advice, drafting, representation at hearings or otherwise. It is not the function of court staff to give legal advice; however, subject to that, they will do their best to assist any litigant. Judges are not in a position to give advice about the conduct of a claim\\n[30]: 2.9 There is general information available to litigants in person on the judiciary website here: Advice for Litigants in Person - Courts and Tribunals Judiciary\\n[31]: 2.10 The following is a non-exhaustive list of sources of assistance to litigants in person.\\n[32]: 2.11 Litigants in person who are enquiring as to the possibility of obtaining legal assistance or representation through legal aid may contact Civil Legal Advice at 03453454345 ( 9.00 am to 8.00 pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays) or on the website at https://www.gov.uk/civil-legal-advice. In general, while the availability of legal aid has become very restricted under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicants will probably be directed to pursue their enquiries via firms of solicitors practising in areas of legal aid.\\n[33]: 2.12 An online service which provides practical information on rights and the law in England and Wales. https://www.advicenow.org.uk/\\n[34]: 2.13 There is an RCJ Advice Bureau off the Main Hall at the RCJ. The Bureau runs an appointment-based service. To request an appointment, applicants should complete the civil triage form available on their website (www. rcjadvice.org.uk) and email it to them at civiltriage@rcjadvice.org or call into the office to complete the form between 9.30am and 1pm and 2pm and 4.30pm weekdays. Their website has details on all their services and how to access them (www.rcjadvice.org.uk)\\n[35]: 2.14 Support Through Court (previously known as The Personal Support Unit (PSU)) is an independent charity which supports litigants in person, witnesses, victims, their family members and other supporters attending the Royal Courts of Justice and other courts across the country. Requests vary from the very simple to the complex. Some people just require directions or advice about procedures. Others need to unburden themselves, while others request the moral and emotional support of being accompanied in court. STC can be particularly helpful for clients with special needs.\\n[36]: 2.15 The volunteers are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice or representation. They can provide procedural information, help to organise and complete paperwork, look up relevant information and discuss settling issues without going to court. They can help before hearings by helping litigants put their thoughts in order, provide emotional support in court and make sure the litigant understands what was discussed in the hearing and the next steps.\\n[37]: 2.16 The office in the RCJ is open Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 4 pm (closed for lunch between 1 and 1.45 pm ). Walk-ins are accepted subject to availability. Face-to-face and remote appointments can be booked in advance: https://www.supportthroughcourt.org/locations/ london/rcj-appointment/.\\n[38]: 2.17 Support for general enquiries is available on 02045205959 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 12.30pm.\\n[39]: 2.18 Its address is: Thomas Moore Building (ground floor), Royal Courts of Justice, Strand WC2A 2LL. Tel: 02045205959.\\n[40]: 2.19 There are charities through which qualified Lawyers provide advice without charge (known as \\\"pro bono\\\") for some cases. See https://www.lawworks. org.uk/ and https://weareadvocate.org.uk/.\\n[41]: 2.20 Advocate is the national pro bono charity of the Bar. They find barristers for people in England and Wales who are not eligible for legal aid and cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. They help with: Specialist legal advice, drafting and representation and help at mediation. Advocate works exclusively with barristers and, as such, can only consider cases that are appropriate for barrister assistance. In essence this means that it would need to be representation in a court or Tribunal in England or Wales or advice or drafting suitable for a barrister to provide. In practice this means different things for different areas of law. Applicants should visit www.weareadvocate. org.uk for information about how to apply.\\n[42]: 2.21 Barristers who are qualified to work under the direct access scheme can be contacted directly by litigants. This is not a free legal advice scheme but enables litigants to instruct a barrister directly to assist them for example with a court hearing. Further details can be found through the Bar Council direct access portal: Homepage (directaccessportal.co.uk)\\n[43]: 2.22 Hearings are dealt with more fully in Section 9 below, to which reference should be made. See in particular 9.88-9.89 about contacting the court in advance of any hearings if assistance is required to access the court due to disability or other vulnerability of a party or witness.\\n[44]: 2.23 Ordinarily, the claimant or applicant is asked to put together an indexed and paginated file of the relevant documents for the court for the purposes of the hearing (called hearing bundles). Where a claimant or applicant is unrepresented, a represented defendant or respondent may be directed to provide the hearing bundles. Parties often file at court, and serve on the other parties, skeleton arguments (written summaries of their arguments and submissions) before a hearing.\\n[45]: 2.24 Litigants in person should identify in advance of any hearing those points which they consider to be their strongest points, and they should put those points first in their oral and any written submissions to the court.\\n[46]: 2.25 Before a hearing starts a litigant in person should be given by any other party, and should provide to other parties, photocopies of any legal authorities (past judicial decisions and/or statutes and/or textbooks) which are to be cited to the court in addition to any skeleton argument(s). These should be provided well before the hearing rather than at the door of the court.\\n[47]: 2.26 In drafting proposed or actual case management directions the parties and the court should make use of any relevant standard directions (which can be found online at http://www.justice.gov.uk//courts/procedure-rules/civil) and adapt them to the circumstances of the case.\\n[48]: 2.27 Any legal representative in the case should ask the litigant in person to give their name (and to give details of any special arrangements that they may wish to request e.g. in consequence of any disability) to the usher or in-court support staff if they have not already done so.\\n[49]: 2.28 Proper allowances in relation to hearings will be made in recognition of the difficulties facing litigants in person. The court will aim to enable the unrepresented party's case to be put forward in a way which ensures that the proceedings are conducted fairly.\\n[50]: 2.29 Where a litigant in person is the applicant, the court may ask one of the represented parties to speak first in court and explain the case briefly and impartially, and to summarise the issues.\\n[51]: 2.30 The Judge may ask a litigant in person the matters about which their witness may be able to give evidence or on which a witness called by another party ought to be cross-examined, and if necessary put to the witness such questions as the court considers proper.\\n[52]: 2.31 If a litigant in person wishes to give oral evidence he or she will generally be required to do so from the witness box in the same manner as any other witness of fact.\\n[53]: 2.32 At the end of the hearing, the judge will explain the Order they make. Representatives for other parties should also explain the court's order after the hearing if the litigant in person does not appear to understand it.\\n[54]: 2.33 A litigant in person may be assisted at any hearing by an unqualified person (often referred to as a McKenzie friend) subject to the discretion of the court. The Court will generally consider a request by the litigant in person to have a McKenzie friend in accordance with the Guidance in Practice Note (McKenzie friends: Civil and Family Courts) [2010] 1 WLR 1881.\\n[55]: 2.34 There is a presumption that a McKenzie friend should be permitted but the Guidance gives various examples of reasons as to why they might not. Different considerations may apply where the person seeking the right of audience is being paid or remunerated to do so and litigants in person applying to have a McKenzie friend should be prepared to disclose whether the McKenzie friend is being paid or remunerated and if so how the pay or remuneration is calculated.\\n[56]: 2.35 The following is a summary of the requirements for the assistance of a McKenzie Friend:\\n[57]: 2.36 The court may stop a McKenzie Friend from assisting if the court believes there is good reason to do so in any individual case. If the court considers that a person is abusing the right to be a McKenzie Friend (for example, by attending in numerous claims to the detriment of the litigant(s) and/or the court) and this abuse amounts to an interference with the proper processes of the administration of justice, the court may make an order restricting or preventing a person from acting as a McKenzie Friend.\\n[58]: 2.37 If a person has been declared a vexatious litigant or has a civil restraint order against them, they are unlikely to be given permission to act as a McKenzie Friend.

The question whether legal representatives should include VAT in respect of these payments when invoicing their clients or in claims for costs between litigants should be decided in accordance with this Practice Direction and with the criteria set out in the VAT Guide (Notice 700).\\n\\n(2) Payments to third parties which are normally treated as part of the legal representative's overheads (for example, postage costs and telephone costs) will not be treated as disbursements. The third party supply should be included as part of the costs of the legal representatives' legal services and VAT must be added to the total bill charged to the client.\\n\\n(3) Disputes may arise in respect of payments made to a third party which the legal representative shows as disbursements in the invoice delivered to the receiving party. Some payments, although correctly described as disbursements for some purposes, are not classified as disbursements for VAT purposes. Items not classified as disbursements for VAT purposes must be shown as part of the services provided by the legal representative and, therefore, VAT must be added in respect of them whether or not VAT was chargeable on the supply by the third party.\\n\\n(4) Guidance as to the circumstances in which disbursements may or may not be classified as disbursements for VAT purposes is given in the VAT Guide (Notice 700, paragraph 25.1). One of the key issues is whether the third party supply -\\n\\n(a) was made to the legal representative (and therefore subsumed in the onward supply of legal services); or\\n\\n(b) was made direct to the receiving party (the third party having no right to demand payment from the legal representative, who makes the payment only as agent for the receiving party).\\n\\n(5) Examples of payments under subparagraph (4)(a) are: travelling expenses, such as an airline ticket, and subsistence expenses, such as the cost of meals, where the person travelling and receiving the meals is the legal representative. The supplies by the airline and the restaurant are supplies to the legal representative, not to the client\\n\\n(6) Payments under subparagraph (4)(b) are classified as disbursements for VAT purposes and, therefore, the legal representative need not add VAT in respect of them.

Where the receiving party is able to obtain credit from HMRC for a proportion of the VAT as input tax, only that proportion which is not eligible for credit should be included in the claim for costs.\\n\\n2.4\\n\\nThe receiving party has responsibility for ensuring that VAT is claimed only when the receiving party is unable to recover the VAT or a proportion thereof as input tax.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.5\\n\\nWhere there is a dispute as to whether VAT is properly claimed the receiving party must provide a certificate signed by the legal representatives or the auditors of the receiving party substantially in the form illustrated in Precedent F in the Schedule of Costs Precedents annexed to Practice Direction 47. Where the receiving party is a litigant in person who is claiming VAT, evidence to support the claim (such as a letter from HMRC) must be produced at the hearing at which the costs are assessed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.6\\n\\nWhere there is a dispute as to whether any service in respect of which a charge is proposed to be made in the bill is zero rated or exempt from VAT, reference should be made to HMRC and its view obtained and made known at the hearing at which the costs are assessed. Such enquiry should be made by the receiving party. In the case of a bill from a solicitor to the solicitor's legal representative's own client, such enquiry should be made by the client.\\n\\n---\\n\\nForm of bill of costs where VAT rate changes\\n\\n2.7\\n\\nWhere there is a change in the rate of VAT, suppliers of goods and services are entitled by sections 88 (1) and 88(2) of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 in most circumstances to elect whether the new or the old rate of VAT should apply to a supply where the basic and actual tax points span a period during which the rate changed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.8\\n\\nIt will be assumed, unless a contrary indication is given in writing, that an election to take advantage of the provisions mentioned in paragraph 2.7 and to charge VAT at the lower rate has been made. In any case in which an election to charge at the lower rate is not made, such a decision must be justified to the court assessing the costs.\\n\\nApportionment\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.9\\n\\nSubject to 2.7 and 2.8, all bills of costs, fees and disbursements on which VAT is included must be divided into separate parts so as to show work done before, on and after the date or dates from which any change in the rate of VAT takes effect. Where, however, a lump sum charge is made for work which spans a period during which there has been a change in VAT rates, and paragraphs 2.7 and 2.8 above do not apply, reference should be made to paragraphs 30.7 or 30.8 of the VAT Guide (Notice 700) (or any revised edition of that notice) published by HMRC. If necessary, the lump sum should be apportioned. The totals of profit costs and disbursements in each part must be carried separately to the summary.\\n\\n---\\n\\nChange in VAT rate between the conclusion of a detailed settlement and the issue of a final certificate\\n\\n2.10\\n\\nShould there be a change in the rate between the conclusion of a detailed assessment and the issue of the final costs certificate, any interested party may apply for the detailed assessment to be varied so as to take account of any increase or reduction in the amount of tax payable. Once the final costs certificate has been issued, no variation under this paragraph will be permitted.\\n\\n---\\n\\nDisbursements not classified as such for VAT purposes\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.11\\n\\n(1) Legal representatives often make payments to third parties for the supply of goods or services where no VAT was chargeable on the supply by the third party: for example, the cost of meals taken and travel costs. The question whether legal representatives should include VAT in respect of these payments when invoicing their clients or in claims for costs between litigants should be decided in accordance with this Practice Direction and with the criteria set out in the VAT Guide (Notice 700).\\n\\n(2) Payments to third parties which are normally treated as part of the legal representative's overheads (for example, postage costs and telephone costs) will not be treated as disbursements. The third party supply should be included as part of the costs of the legal representatives' legal services and VAT must be added to the total bill charged to the client.\\n\\n(3) Disputes may arise in respect of payments made to a third party which the legal representative shows as disbursements in the invoice delivered to the receiving party. Some payments, although correctly described as disbursements for some purposes, are not classified as disbursements for VAT purposes. Items not classified as disbursements for VAT purposes must be shown as part of the services provided by the legal representative and, therefore, VAT must be added in respect of them whether or not VAT was chargeable on the supply by the third party.\\n\\n(4) Guidance as to the circumstances in which disbursements may or may not be classified as disbursements for VAT purposes is given in the VAT Guide (Notice 700, paragraph 25.1). One of the key issues is whether the third party supply -\\n\\n(a) was made to the legal representative (and therefore subsumed in the onward supply of legal services); or\\n\\n(b) was made direct to the receiving party (the third party having no right to demand payment from the legal representative, who makes the payment only as agent for the receiving party).\\n\\n(5) Examples of payments under subparagraph (4)(a) are: travelling expenses, such as an airline ticket, and subsistence expenses, such as the cost of meals, where the person travelling and receiving the meals is the legal representative. The supplies by the airline and the restaurant are supplies to the legal representative, not to the client\\n\\n(6) Payments under subparagraph (4)(b) are classified as disbursements for VAT purposes and, therefore, the legal representative need not add VAT in respect of them. Simple examples are payments by a legal representative of court fees and payment of fees to an expert witness.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLitigants in person\\n\\n2.12\\n\\nWhere a litigant acts in person, that litigant is not treated for the purposes of VAT as having supplied services and therefore no VAT is chargeable in respect of work done by that litigant (even where, for example, that litigant is a solicitor or other legal representative). Consequently in such circumstances a bill of costs should not claim any VAT.\\n\\nGovernment Departments\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.13\\n\\nOn an assessment between parties, where costs are being paid to a Government Department in respect of services rendered by its legal staff, VAT should not be added.\\n\\nPayment pursuant to an order under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act\\n\\n2.14\\n\\nWhere an order is made under section 194(3) of the 2007 Act, any bill presented for agreement or assessment pursuant to that order must not include a claim for VAT.\\n\\nCosts budgets\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.1\\n\\nIn any case where the parties have filed budgets in accordance with Practice Direction 3 D but the court has not made a costs management order under rule 3.15, the provisions of this subsection shall apply.\\n\\n3.2\\n\\nIf there is a difference of 20% or more between the costs claimed by a receiving party on detailed assessment and the costs shown in a budget filed by that party, the receiving party must provide a statement of the reasons for the difference with the bill of costs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.3\\n\\nIf a paying party -\\n\\n(a) claims to have reasonably relied on a budget filed by a receiving party; or\\n\\n(b) wishes to rely upon the costs shown in the budget in order to dispute the reasonableness or proportionality of the costs claimed,\\n\\nthe paying party must serve a statement setting out the case in this regard in that party's points of dispute.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.4\\n\\nOn an assessment of the costs of a party, the court will have regard to the last approved or agreed budget, and may have regard to any other budget previously filed by that party, or by any other party in the same proceedings. Such other budgets may be taken into account when assessing the reasonableness and proportionality of any costs claimed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.5\\n\\nSubject to paragraph 3.4, paragraphs 3.6 and 3.7 apply where there is a difference of 20% or more between the costs claimed by a receiving party and the costs shown in a budget filed by that party.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.6\\n\\nWhere it appears to the court that the paying party reasonably relied on the budget, the court may restrict the recoverable costs to such sum as is reasonable for the paying party to pay in the light of that reliance, notwithstanding that such sum is less than the amount of costs reasonably and proportionately incurred by the receiving party.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3.7\\n\\nWhere it appears to the court that the receiving party has not provided a satisfactory explanation for that difference, the court may regard the difference between the costs claimed and the costs shown in the budget as evidence that the costs claimed are unreasonable or disproportionate.\\n\\nCourt's discretion as to costs: rule 44.2\\n\\n4.1\\n\\nThe court may make an order about costs at any stage in a case.\\n\\n---\\n\\n4.2\\n\\nThere are certain costs orders which the court will commonly make in proceedings before trial. The following table sets out the general effect of these orders. The table is not an exhaustive list of the orders which the court may make.\\n\\nCosts\\n\\nCosts in any event\\n\\nCosts in the case\\n\\nCosts in the application\\n\\nCosts reserved\\n\\nClaimant's/Defendant's costs in case/application\\n\\nCosts thrown away\\n\\n• preparing for and attending any hearing at which the judgment or order which has been set aside was made;\\n• preparing for and attending any hearing to set aside the judgment or order in question;\\n• preparing for and attending any hearing at which the court orders the proceedings or the part in question to be adjourned;\\n• any steps taken to enforce a judgment or order which has subsequently been set aside.\\n\\nCosts of and caused by\\n\\nCosts here and below\\n\\nNo order as to costs\\n\\nEach party to pay own costs\\n\\n---\\n\\nFees of Counsel\\n\\n---\\n\\n5.1\\n\\n(1) When making an order for costs the court may state an opinion as to whether or not the hearing was fit for the attendance of one or more counsel, and, if it does so, the court conducting a detailed assessment of those costs will have regard to the opinion stated.\\n\\n(2) The court will generally express an opinion only where -\\n\\n(a) the paying party asks it to do so;\\n\\n(b) more than one counsel appeared for a party; or\\n\\n(c) the court wishes to record its opinion that the case was not fit for the attendance of counsel.\\n\\n---\\n\\n5.2\\n\\n(1) Where the court refers any matter to the conveyancing counsel of the court the fees payable to counsel in respect of the work done or to be done will be assessed by the court in accordance with rule 44.2.\\n\\n(2) An appeal from a decision of the court in respect of the fees of such counsel will be dealt with under the general rules as to appeals set out in Part 52. If the appeal is against the decision of an authorised court officer, it will be dealt with in accordance with rules 47.22 to 47.24.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBasis of assessment: rule 44.3\\n\\nCosts on the indemnity basis\\n\\n6.1\\n\\nIf costs are awarded on the indemnity basis, the court assessing costs will disallow any costs -\\n\\n(a) which it finds to have been unreasonably incurred; or\\n\\n(b) which it considers to be unreasonable in amount.\\n\\nCosts on the standard basis\\n\\n---\\n\\n6.2\\n\\nIf costs are awarded on the standard basis, the court assessing costs will disallow any costs -\\n\\n(a) which it finds to have been unreasonably incurred;\\n\\n(b) which it considers to be unreasonable in amount;\\n\\n(c) which it considers to have been disproportionately incurred or to be disproportionate in amount; or\\n\\n(d) about which it has doubts as to whether they were reasonably or proportionately incurred, or whether they are reasonable and proportionate in amount.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAmount of costs where costs are payable pursuant to a contract: rule 44.5\\n\\nApplication of rule 44.5\\n\\n7.1\\n\\nRule 44.5 only applies if the court is assessing costs payable under a contract. It does not -\\n\\n(a) require the court to make an assessment of such costs; or\\n\\n(b) require a mortgagee to apply for an order for those costs where there is a contractual right to recover out of the mortgage funds.\\n\\nCosts relating to a mortgage\\n\\n---\\n\\n7.2\\n\\n(1) The following principles apply to costs relating to a mortgage.\\n\\n(2) An order for the payment of costs of proceedings by one party to another is always a discretionary order: section 51 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 ('the section 51 discretion').\\n\\n(3) Where there is a contractual right to the costs, the discretion should ordinarily be exercised so as to reflect that contractual right.\\n\\n(4) The power of the court to disallow a mortgagee's costs sought to be added to the mortgage security is a power that does not derive from section 51, but from the power of the courts of equity to fix the terms on which redemption will be allowed.\\n\\n(5) A decision by a court to refuse costs in whole or in part to a mortgagee may be -\\n\\n(a) a decision in the exercise of the section 51 discretion;\\n\\n(b) a decision in the exercise of the power to fix the terms on which redemption will be allowed;\\n\\n(c) a decision as to the extent of a mortgagee's contractual right to add the mortgagee's costs to the security; or\\n\\n(d) a combination of two or more of these things.\\n\\n(6) A mortgagee is not to be deprived of a contractual or equitable right to add costs to the security merely by reason of an order for payment of costs made without reference to the mortgagee's contractual or equitable rights, and without any adjudication as to whether or not the mortgagee should be deprived of those costs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n7.3\\n\\n(1) Where the contract entitles a mortgagee to -\\n\\n(a) add the costs of litigation relating to the mortgage to the sum secured by it; or\\n\\n(b) require a mortgagor to pay those costs,\\n\\nthe mortgagor may make an application for the court to direct that an account of the mortgagee's costs be taken.\\n\\n(Rule 25.1(1)(o) provides that the court may direct that a party file an account.)\\n\\n(2) The mortgagor may then dispute an amount in the mortgagee's account on the basis that it has been unreasonably incurred or is unreasonable in amount.\\n\\n(3) Where a mortgagor disputes an amount, the court may make an order that the disputed costs are assessed under rule 44.5.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProcedure for assessing costs: rule 44.6\\n\\n8.1\\n\\nSubject to paragraph 8.3, where the court does not order fixed costs (or no fixed costs are provided for) the amount of costs payable will be assessed by the court. Rule 44.6 allows the court making an order about costs either -\\n\\n(a) to make a summary assessment of the amount of the costs; or\\n\\n(b) to order the amount to be decided in accordance with Part 47 (a detailed assessment).\\n\\n---\\n\\n8.2\\n\\nAn order for costs will be treated as an order for the amount of costs to be decided by a detailed assessment unless the order otherwise provides.\\n\\n8.3\\n\\nWhere a party is entitled to costs some of which are fixed costs and some of which are not, the court will assess those costs which are not fixed. The decision whether such assessment should be summary or detailed will be made in accordance with paragraphs 9.1 to 9.10 of this Practice Direction.\\n\\nSummary assessment: general provisions\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhen the court should consider whether to make a summary assessment\\n\\n9.1\\n\\nWhenever a court makes an order about costs which does not provide only for fixed costs to be paid the court should consider whether to make a summary assessment of costs.\\n\\nTiming of summary assessment\\n\\n---\\n\\n9.2\\n\\nThe general rule is that the court should make a summary assessment of the costs -\\n\\n(a) at the conclusion of the trial of a case which has been dealt with on the fast track, in which case the order will deal with the costs of the whole claim; and\\n\\n(b) at the conclusion of any other hearing, which has lasted not more than one day, in which case the order will deal with the costs of the application or matter to which the hearing related. If this hearing disposes of the claim, the order may deal with the costs of the whole claim,\\n\\nunless there is good reason not to do so, for example where the paying party shows substantial grounds for disputing the sum claimed for costs that cannot be dealt with summarily.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSummary assessment of mortgagee's costs\\n\\n9.3\\n\\nThe general rule in paragraph 9.2 does not apply to a mortgagee's costs incurred in mortgage possession proceedings or other proceedings relating to a mortgage unless the mortgagee asks the court to make an order for the mortgagee's costs to be paid by another party.\\n\\n(Paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3 deal in more detail with costs relating to mortgages.)\\n\\nConsent orders\\n\\n---\\n\\n9.4\\n\\nWhere an application has been made and the parties to the application agree an order by consent without any party attending, the parties should seek to agree a figure for costs to be inserted in the consent order or agree that there should be no order for costs.\\n\\nDuty of parties and legal representatives\\n\\n---\\n\\n9.5\\n\\n(1) It is the duty of the parties and their legal representatives to assist the judge in making a summary assessment of costs in any case to which paragraph 9.2 above applies, in accordance with the following subparagraphs.\\n\\n(2) Each party who intends to claim costs must prepare a written statement of those costs showing separately in the form of a schedule -\\n\\n(a) the number of hours to be claimed;\\n\\n(b) the hourly rate to be claimed;\\n\\n(c) the grade of fee earner;\\n\\n(d) the amount and nature of any disbursement to be claimed, other than counsel's fee for appearing at the hearing;\\n\\n(e) the amount of legal representative's costs to be claimed for attending or appearing at the hearing;\\n\\n(f) counsel's fees; and\\n\\n(g) any VAT to be claimed on these amounts.\\n\\n(3) The statement of costs should follow as closely as possible Form N 260 and must be signed by the party or the party's legal representative.

These regulations may be cited as the Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 and shall come into force on April 1, 1994.\\n\\n(2) These Regulations shall govern the enrolment in the Central Office of the Supreme Court of deeds evidencing change of name (referred to in these Regulations as 'deeds poll').\\n\\n(1) A person seeking to enrol a deed poll ('the applicant') must be a Commonwealth citizen as defined by section 37(1) of the British Nationality Act 1981.\\n\\n(2) If the applicant is a British citizen, a British Dependent Territories citizen or a British Overseas citizen, he must be described as such in the deed poll, which must also specify the section of the British Nationality Act under which the relevant citizenship was acquired.\\n\\n(3) In any other case, the applicant must be described as a Commonwealth citizen.\\n\\n(4) The applicant must be described in the deed poll as single, married, widowed, divorced, a civil partner or former civil partner and, if a former civil partner, whether the civil partnership ended on death or dissolution.\\n\\n(1) As proof of the citizenship named in the deed poll, the applicant must produce:\\n\\n(a) a certificate of birth; or\\n\\n(b) a certificate of citizenship by registration or naturalisation or otherwise; or\\n\\n(c) some other document evidencing such citizenship.\\n\\n(2) In addition to the documents set out in paragraph (1), an applicant who is married or a civil partner must:\\n\\n(a) produce his certificate of marriage or civil partnership certificate; and\\n\\n(b) show that the notice of his intention to apply for the enrolment of the deed poll had been given to his spouse or civil partner by delivery or by post to his spouse's or civil partner's last known address; and\\n\\n(c) show that he has obtained the consent of his spouse or civil partner to the proposed change of name or that there is good reason why such consent should be dispensed with.\\n\\n(1) The deed poll and the documents referred to in regulation 3 must be exhibited to a statutory declaration by a Commonwealth citizen who is a householder in the United Kingdom and who must declare that he is such in the statutory declaration.\\n\\n(2) The statutory declaration must state the period, which should ordinarily not be less than 10 years, during which the householder has known the applicant and must identify the applicant as the person referred to in the documents exhibited to the statutory declaration.\\n\\n(3) Where the period mentioned in paragraph (2) is stated to be less than 10 years, the Master of the Rolls may in his absolute discretion decide whether to permit the deed poll to be enrolled and may require the applicant to provide more information before so deciding.\\n\\n5 If the applicant is resident outside the United Kingdom, he must provide evidence that such residence is not intended to be permanent and the applicant may be required to produce a certificate by a solicitor as to the nature and probable duration of such residence.\\n\\n6 The applicant must sign the deed poll in both his old and new names.\\n\\n7 Upon enrolment the deed poll shall be advertised in the London Gazette by the clerk in charge for the time being of the Filing and Record Department at the Central Office of the Supreme Court.\\n\\n(1) Subject to the following provisions of this regulation, these Regulations shall apply in relation to a deed poll evidencing the change of name of a child as if the child were the applicant.\\n\\n(2) Paragraphs (3) to (8) shall not apply to a child who has attained the age of 16 and is or has been married or a civil partner.\\n\\n(3) If the child is under the age of 16, the deed poll must be executed by a person having parental responsibility for him.\\n\\n(4) If the child has attained the age of 16, the deed poll must, except in the case of a person mentioned in paragraph (2), be executed by a person having parental responsibility for the child and be endorsed with the child's consent signed in both his old and new names and duly witnessed.\\n\\n(5) The application for enrolment must be supported:\\n\\n(a) by a witness statement showing that the change of name is for the benefit of the child; and -\\n\\n(i) that the application is submitted by all persons having parental responsibility for the child; or\\n\\n(ii) that it is submitted by one person having parental responsibility for the child with the consent of every other person; or\\n\\n(iii) that it is submitted by one person having parental responsibility for the child without the consent of every other such person, or by some other person whose name and capacity are given, for reasons set out in the affidavit; and\\n\\n(b) by such other evidence, if any, as the Master of the Rolls may require in the particular circumstances of the case.\\n\\n(6) Regulation 4(2) shall not apply but the statutory declaration mentioned in regulation 4(1) shall state how long the householder has known the deponent under paragraph (5)(a) and the child respectively.\\n\\n(7) Regulation 6 shall not apply to a child who has not attained the age of 16.\\n\\n(8) In this regulation 'parental responsibility' has the meaning given in section 3 of the Children Act 1989.\\n\\n9 The Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1983 and the Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) (Amendment) Regulations 1990 are hereby revoked.\", \"filepath\": \"Court Documents\", \"groups\": [], \"id\": \"Practice_Direction_5A___Court_Documents_subsection_19\",

The rules of practice and procedure apply to litigants in person in the same way as represented parties. The provisions of this guide also apply to litigants in person. The Court will have regard to the fact a party is unrepresented (see CPR3.1A) but it will not usually apply a lower standard of compliance with rules, PDs or orders of the court (see Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] UKSC 12:)\\n\\n2.2 Basic practical information about bringing a case to court can be found on the government website: King's Bench Division: bring a case to the court GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).\\n\\n2.3 Represented parties must treat litigants in person with consideration and respect at all times during the conduct of the litigation. Similarly, litigants in person must show consideration and respect to their opponents, whether legally represented or not, and to the court.\\n\\n2.4 A litigant in person must give an address for service in England or Wales. If they are a claimant, the address will be required in the claim form or other document by which the proceedings are started. If they are a defendant, it will be in the acknowledgment of service form which must be sent to the court. It is essential that any change of address is notified in writing to the Central Office and to all other parties to the case, otherwise important communications such as notices of hearing dates may not reach the relevant person (although they are likely to be treated as having done so).\\n\\n2.5 The public is entitled to obtain copies of some of the documents that parties file at court unless the court has ordered otherwise. Please see further sections within this guide on online public search, open justice, anonymity, confidential documents, non disclosure orders and Tomlin orders and see CPR5.4B and 5.4C and PD5A.\\n\\n2.6 It is the duty of all parties to litigation, whether represented or not, to bring relevant matters to the attention of the court and not to mislead the court. This means for example that they must not misrepresent the law and must therefore inform the court of any relevant legislation or previous court decisions which are applicable to their case and of which they are aware (whether favourable or not to their case); and must draw the court's attention to any relevant irregularity.\\n\\n2.7 In addition, there is a particular duty when an application is made to the court without the other party being present (for example in the case of urgency or when seeing a judge at an 'Application without Notice'). Here the litigant is under a duty to disclose any facts or other matters (including arguments of fact or of law) which might be relevant to the court's decision, even if adverse to their case, and specifically draw the court's attention to such matters.\\n\\n2.8 In many cases the parties will need legal assistance, whether by way of advice, drafting, representation at hearings or otherwise. It is not the function of court staff to give legal advice; however, subject to that, they will do their best to assist any litigant. Judges are not in a position to give advice about the conduct of a claim\\n\\n2.9 There is general information available to litigants in person on the judiciary website here: Advice for Litigants in Person - Courts and Tribunals Judiciary\\n\\n2.10 The following is a non-exhaustive list of sources of assistance to litigants in person.\\n\\n2.11 Litigants in person who are enquiring as to the possibility of obtaining legal assistance or representation through legal aid may contact Civil Legal Advice at 03453454345 ( 9.00 am to 8.00 pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays) or on the website at https://www.gov.uk/civil-legal-advice. In general, while the availability of legal aid has become very restricted under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicants will probably be directed to pursue their enquiries via firms of solicitors practising in areas of legal aid.\\n\\n2.12 An online service which provides practical information on rights and the law in England and Wales. https://www.advicenow.org.uk/\\n\\n2.13 There is an RCJ Advice Bureau off the Main Hall at the RCJ. The Bureau runs an appointment-based service. To request an appointment, applicants should complete the civil triage form available on their website (www. rcjadvice.org.uk) and email it to them at civiltriage@rcjadvice.org or call into the office to complete the form between 9.30am and 1pm and 2pm and 4.30pm weekdays. Their website has details on all their services and how to access them (www.rcjadvice.org.uk)\\n\\n2.14 Support Through Court (previously known as The Personal Support Unit (PSU)) is an independent charity which supports litigants in person, witnesses, victims, their family members and other supporters attending the Royal Courts of Justice and other courts across the country. Requests vary from the very simple to the complex. Some people just require directions or advice about procedures. Others need to unburden themselves, while others request the moral and emotional support of being accompanied in court. STC can be particularly helpful for clients with special needs.\\n\\n2.15 The volunteers are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice or representation. They can provide procedural information, help to organise and complete paperwork, look up relevant information and discuss settling issues without going to court. They can help before hearings by helping litigants put their thoughts in order, provide emotional support in court and make sure the litigant understands what was discussed in the hearing and the next steps.\\n\\n2.16 The office in the RCJ is open Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 4 pm (closed for lunch between 1 and 1.45 pm ). Walk-ins are accepted subject to availability. Face-to-face and remote appointments can be booked in advance: https://www.supportthroughcourt.org/locations/ london/rcj-appointment/.\\n\\n2.17 Support for general enquiries is available on 02045205959 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 12.30pm.\\n\\n2.18 Its address is: Thomas Moore Building (ground floor), Royal Courts of Justice, Strand WC2A 2LL. Tel: 02045205959.\\n\\n2.19 There are charities through which qualified Lawyers provide advice without charge (known as \\\"pro bono\\\") for some cases. See https://www.lawworks. org.uk/ and https://weareadvocate.org.uk/.\\n\\n2.20 Advocate is the national pro bono charity of the Bar. They find barristers for people in England and Wales who are not eligible for legal aid and cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. They help with: Specialist legal advice, drafting and representation and help at mediation. Advocate works exclusively with barristers and, as such, can only consider cases that are appropriate for barrister assistance. In essence this means that it would need to be representation in a court or Tribunal in England or Wales or advice or drafting suitable for a barrister to provide. In practice this means different things for different areas of law. Applicants should visit www.weareadvocate. org.uk for information about how to apply.\\n\\n2.21 Barristers who are qualified to work under the direct access scheme can be contacted directly by litigants. This is not a free legal advice scheme but enables litigants to instruct a barrister directly to assist them for example with a court hearing. Further details can be found through the Bar Council direct access portal: Homepage (directaccessportal.co.uk)\\n\\n2.22 Hearings are dealt with more fully in Section 9 below, to which reference should be made. See in particular 9.88-9.89 about contacting the court in advance of any hearings if assistance is required to access the court due to disability or other vulnerability of a party or witness.\\n\\n2.23 Ordinarily, the claimant or applicant is asked to put together an indexed and paginated file of the relevant documents for the court for the purposes of the hearing (called hearing bundles). Where a claimant or applicant is unrepresented, a represented defendant or respondent may be directed to provide the hearing bundles. Parties often file at court, and serve on the other parties, skeleton arguments (written summaries of their arguments and submissions) before a hearing.\\n\\n2.24 Litigants in person should identify in advance of any hearing those points which they consider to be their strongest points, and they should put those points first in their oral and any written submissions to the court.\\n\\n2.25 Before a hearing starts a litigant in person should be given by any other party, and should provide to other parties, photocopies of any legal authorities (past judicial decisions and/or statutes and/or textbooks) which are to be cited to the court in addition to any skeleton argument(s). These should be provided well before the hearing rather than at the door of the court.\\n\\n2.26 In drafting proposed or actual case management directions the parties and the court should make use of any relevant standard directions (which can be found online at http://www.justice.gov.uk//courts/procedure-rules/civil) and adapt them to the circumstances of the case.\\n\\n2.27 Any legal representative in the case should ask the litigant in person to give their name (and to give details of any special arrangements that they may wish to request e.g. in consequence of any disability) to the usher or in-court support staff if they have not already done so.\\n\\n2.28 Proper allowances in relation to hearings will be made in recognition of the difficulties facing litigants in person. The court will aim to enable the unrepresented party's case to be put forward in a way which ensures that the proceedings are conducted fairly.\\n\\n2.29 Where a litigant in person is the applicant, the court may ask one of the represented parties to speak first in court and explain the case briefly and impartially, and to summarise the issues.\\n\\n2.30 The Judge may ask a litigant in person the matters about which their witness may be able to give evidence or on which a witness called by another party ought to be cross-examined, and if necessary put to the witness such questions as the court considers proper.\\n\\n2.31 If a litigant in person wishes to give oral evidence he or she will generally be required to do so from the witness box in the same manner as any other witness of fact.\\n\\n2.32 At the end of the hearing, the judge will explain the Order they make. Representatives for other parties should also explain the court's order after the hearing if the litigant in person does not appear to understand it.\\n\\n2.33 A litigant in person may be assisted at any hearing by an unqualified person (often referred to as a McKenzie friend) subject to the discretion of the court. The Court will generally consider a request by the litigant in person to have a McKenzie friend in accordance with the Guidance in Practice Note (McKenzie friends: Civil and Family Courts) [2010] 1 WLR 1881.\\n\\n2.34 There is a presumption that a McKenzie friend should be permitted but the Guidance gives various examples of reasons as to why they might not. Different considerations may apply where the person seeking the right of audience is being paid or remunerated to do so and litigants in person applying to have a McKenzie friend should be prepared to disclose whether the McKenzie friend is being paid or remunerated and if so how the pay or remuneration is calculated.\\n\\n2.35 The following is a summary of the requirements for the assistance of a McKenzie Friend:\\n\\n2.36 The court may stop a McKenzie Friend from assisting if the court believes there is good reason to do so in any individual case. If the court considers that a person is abusing the right to be a McKenzie Friend (for example, by attending in numerous claims to the detriment of the litigant(s) and/or the court) and this abuse amounts to an interference with the proper processes of the administration of justice, the court may make an order restricting or preventing a person from acting as a McKenzie Friend.\\n\\n2.37 If a person has been declared a vexatious litigant or has a civil restraint order against them, they are unlikely to be given permission to act as a McKenzie Friend.

Before giving a direction the Master or District Judge may require to be satisfied that the request is made in good faith and that the document is required to be produced for the reasons stated.

The rules of practice and procedure apply to litigants in person in the same way as represented parties. The provisions of this guide also apply to litigants in person. The Court will have regard to the fact a party is unrepresented (see CPR3.1A) but it will not usually apply a lower standard of compliance with rules, PDs or orders of the court (see Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] UKSC 12:)\\n[2]: 2.2 Basic practical information about bringing a case to court can be found on the government website: King's Bench Division: bring a case to the court GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).\\n[3]: 2.3 Represented parties must treat litigants in person with consideration and respect at all times during the conduct of the litigation. Similarly, litigants in person must show consideration and respect to their opponents, whether legally represented or not, and to the court.\\n[4]: 2.4 A litigant in person must give an address for service in England or Wales. If they are a claimant, the address will be required in the claim form or other document by which the proceedings are started. If they are a defendant, it will be in the acknowledgment of service form which must be sent to the court. It is essential that any change of address is notified in writing to the Central Office and to all other parties to the case, otherwise important communications such as notices of hearing dates may not reach the relevant person (although they are likely to be treated as having done so).\\n[5]: 2.5 The public is entitled to obtain copies of some of the documents that parties file at court unless the court has ordered otherwise. Please see further sections within this guide on online public search, open justice, anonymity, confidential documents, non disclosure orders and Tomlin orders and see CPR5.4B and 5.4C and PD5A.\\n[6]: 2.6 It is the duty of all parties to litigation, whether represented or not, to bring relevant matters to the attention of the court and not to mislead the court. This means for example that they must not misrepresent the law and must therefore inform the court of any relevant legislation or previous court decisions which are applicable to their case and of which they are aware (whether favourable or not to their case); and must draw the court's attention to any relevant irregularity.\\n[7]: 2.7 In addition, there is a particular duty when an application is made to the court without the other party being present (for example in the case of urgency or when seeing a judge at an 'Application without Notice'). Here the litigant is under a duty to disclose any facts or other matters (including arguments of fact or of law) which might be relevant to the court's decision, even if adverse to their case, and specifically draw the court's attention to such matters.\\n[8]: 2.8 In many cases the parties will need legal assistance, whether by way of advice, drafting, representation at hearings or otherwise. It is not the function of court staff to give legal advice; however, subject to that, they will do their best to assist any litigant. Judges are not in a position to give advice about the conduct of a claim\\n[9]: 2.9 There is general information available to litigants in person on the judiciary website here: Advice for Litigants in Person - Courts and Tribunals Judiciary\\n[10]: 2.10 The following is a non-exhaustive list of sources of assistance to litigants in person.\\n[11]: 2.11 Litigants in person who are enquiring as to the possibility of obtaining legal assistance or representation through legal aid may contact Civil Legal Advice at 03453454345 ( 9.00 am to 8.00 pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays) or on the website at https://www.gov.uk/civil-legal-advice. In general, while the availability of legal aid has become very restricted under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicants will probably be directed to pursue their enquiries via firms of solicitors practising in areas of legal aid.\\n[12]: 2.12 An online service which provides practical information on rights and the law in England and Wales. https://www.advicenow.org.uk/\\n[13]: 2.13 There is an RCJ Advice Bureau off the Main Hall at the RCJ.

Their website has details on all their services and how to access them (www.rcjadvice.org.uk)\\n[14]: 2.14 Support Through Court (previously known as The Personal Support Unit (PSU)) is an independent charity which supports litigants in person, witnesses, victims, their family members and other supporters attending the Royal Courts of Justice and other courts across the country. Requests vary from the very simple to the complex. Some people just require directions or advice about procedures. Others need to unburden themselves, while others request the moral and emotional support of being accompanied in court. STC can be particularly helpful for clients with special needs.\\n[15]: 2.15 The volunteers are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice or representation. They can provide procedural information, help to organise and complete paperwork, look up relevant information and discuss settling issues without going to court. They can help before hearings by helping litigants put their thoughts in order, provide emotional support in court and make sure the litigant understands what was discussed in the hearing and the next steps.\\n[16]: 2.16 The office in the RCJ is open Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 4 pm (closed for lunch between 1 and 1.45 pm ). Walk-ins are accepted subject to availability. Face-to-face and remote appointments can be booked in advance: https://www.supportthroughcourt.org/locations/ london/rcj-appointment/.\\n[17]: 2.17 Support for general enquiries is available on 02045205959 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 12.30pm.\\n[18]: 2.18 Its address is: Thomas Moore Building (ground floor), Royal Courts of Justice, Strand WC2A 2LL. Tel: 02045205959.\\n[19]: 2.19 There are charities through which qualified Lawyers provide advice without charge (known as \\\"pro bono\\\") for some cases. See https://www.lawworks. org.uk/ and https://weareadvocate.org.uk/.\\n[20]: 2.20 Advocate is the national pro bono charity of the Bar. They find barristers for people in England and Wales who are not eligible for legal aid and cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. They help with: Specialist legal advice, drafting and representation and help at mediation. Advocate works exclusively with barristers and, as such, can only consider cases that are appropriate for barrister assistance. In essence this means that it would need to be representation in a court or Tribunal in England or Wales or advice or drafting suitable for a barrister to provide. In practice this means different things for different areas of law. Applicants should visit www.weareadvocate. org.uk for information about how to apply.\\n[21]: 2.21 Barristers who are qualified to work under the direct access scheme can be contacted directly by litigants. This is not a free legal advice scheme but enables litigants to instruct a barrister directly to assist them for example with a court hearing. Further details can be found through the Bar Council direct access portal: Homepage (directaccessportal.co.uk)\\n[22]: 2.22 Hearings are dealt with more fully in Section 9 below, to which reference should be made. See in particular 9.88-9.89 about contacting the court in advance of any hearings if assistance is required to access the court due to disability or other vulnerability of a party or witness.\\n[23]: 2.23 Ordinarily, the claimant or applicant is asked to put together an indexed and paginated file of the relevant documents for the court for the purposes of the hearing (called hearing bundles). Where a claimant or applicant is unrepresented, a represented defendant or respondent may be directed to provide the hearing bundles. Parties often file at court, and serve on the other parties, skeleton arguments (written summaries of their arguments and submissions) before a hearing.\\n[24]: 2.24 Litigants in person should identify in advance of any hearing those points which they consider to be their strongest points, and they should put those points first in their oral and any written submissions to the court.\\n[25]: 2.25 Before a hearing starts a litigant in person should be given by any other party, and should provide to other parties, photocopies of any legal authorities (past judicial decisions and/or statutes and/or textbooks) which are to be cited to the court in addition to any skeleton argument(s). These should be provided well before the hearing rather than at the door of the court.\\n[26]: 2.26 In drafting proposed or actual case management directions the parties and the court should make use of any relevant standard directions (which can be found online at http://www.justice.gov.uk//courts/procedure-rules/civil) and adapt them to the circumstances of the case.\\n[27]: 2.27 Any legal representative in the case should ask the litigant in person to give their name (and to give details of any special arrangements that they may wish to request e.g. in consequence of any disability) to the usher or in-court support staff if they have not already done so.\\n[28]: 2.28 Proper allowances in relation to hearings will be made in recognition of the difficulties facing litigants in person. The court will aim to enable the unrepresented party's case to be put forward in a way which ensures that the proceedings are conducted fairly.\\n[29]: 2.29 Where a litigant in person is the applicant, the court may ask one of the represented parties to speak first in court and explain the case briefly and impartially, and to summarise the issues.\\n[30]: 2.30 The Judge may ask a litigant in person the matters about which their witness may be able to give evidence or on which a witness called by another party ought to be cross-examined, and if necessary put to the witness such questions as the court considers proper.\\n[31]: 2.31 If a litigant in person wishes to give oral evidence he or she will generally be required to do so from the witness box in the same manner as any other witness of fact.\\n[32]: 2.32 At the end of the hearing, the judge will explain the Order they make. Representatives for other parties should also explain the court's order after the hearing if the litigant in person does not appear to understand it.\\n[33]: 2.33 A litigant in person may be assisted at any hearing by an unqualified person (often referred to as a McKenzie friend) subject to the discretion of the court. The Court will generally consider a request by the litigant in person to have a McKenzie friend in accordance with the Guidance in Practice Note (McKenzie friends: Civil and Family Courts) [2010] 1 WLR 1881.\\n[34]: 2.34 There is a presumption that a McKenzie friend should be permitted but the Guidance gives various examples of reasons as to why they might not. Different considerations may apply where the person seeking the right of audience is being paid or remunerated to do so and litigants in person applying to have a McKenzie friend should be prepared to disclose whether the McKenzie friend is being paid or remunerated and if so how the pay or remuneration is calculated.\\n[35]: 2.35 The following is a summary of the requirements for the assistance of a McKenzie Friend:\\n[36]: 2.36 The court may stop a McKenzie Friend from assisting if the court believes there is good reason to do so in any individual case. If the court considers that a person is abusing the right to be a McKenzie Friend (for example, by attending in numerous claims to the detriment of the litigant(s) and/or the court) and this abuse amounts to an interference with the proper processes of the administration of justice, the court may make an order restricting or preventing a person from acting as a McKenzie Friend.\\n[37]: 2.37 If a person has been declared a vexatious litigant or has a civil restraint order against them, they are unlikely to be given permission to act as a McKenzie Friend. See section 16 below on civil restraint orders and vexatious litigants.\\n[38]: 5.1 This part contains general provisions about -(a) documents used in court proceedings; and(b) the obligations of a court officer in relation to those documents.\", \"---\", \"Preparation of documents\\n[39]: 5.2(1) Where under these Rules, a document is to be prepared by the court, the document may be prepared by the party whose document it is, unless -(a) a court officer otherwise directs; or(b) it is a document to which -(i) Revoked(ii) omitted(iii) CCR Order 28, rule 11(1) (issue of warrant of committal),applies.(2) Nothing in this rule shall require a court officer to accept a document which is illegible, has not been duly authorised, or is unsatisfactory for some other similar reason.\", \"---\", \"Signature of documents by mechanical means\\n[40]: 5.3 Where any of these Rules or any practice direction requires a document to be signed, that requirement shall be satisfied if the signature is printed by computer or other mechanical means.\", \"---\", \"Register of claims\\n[41]: 5.4(1) A court or court office may keep a publicly accessible register of claims which have been issued out of that court or court office.(2) Any person who pays the prescribed fee may, during office hours, search any available register of claims.(Practice Direction 5 A contains details of available registers).\", \"---\", \"Supply of documents to Attorney-General from court records\\n[42]: 5.4 A\", \"(1) The Attorney-General may search for, inspect and take a copy of any documents within a court file for the purpose of preparing an application or considering whether to make an application under section 42 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 or section 33 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 (restriction of vexatious proceedings).\", \"(2) The Attorney-General must, when exercising the right under paragraph (1)-\", \"(a) pay any prescribed fee; and\", \"(b) file a written request, which must-\", \"(i) confirm that the request is for the purpose of preparing an application or considering whether to make an application mentioned in paragraph (1); and\", \"(ii) name the person who would be the subject of the application.\", \"---\", \"Supply of documents to a party from court records\\n[43]: 5.4 B(1) A party to proceedings may, unless the court orders otherwise, obtain from the records of the court a copy of any document listed in paragraph 4.2 A of Practice Direction 5 A.(2) A party to proceedings may, if the court gives permission, obtain from the records of the court a copy of any other document filed by a party or communication between the court and a party or another person.\", \"---\", \"Supply of documents to a non-party from court records\\n[44]: 5.4 C(1) The general rule is that a person who is not a party to proceedings may obtain from the court records a copy of -(a) a statement of case, but not any documents filed with or attached to the statement of case, or intended by the party whose statement it is to be served with it;(b) a judgment or order given or made in public (whether made at a hearing or without a hearing).(1 A) Where a non-party seeks to obtain a copy of a statement of case filed before 2 nd October 2006 -(a) this rule does not apply; and(b) the rules of court relating to access by a non-party to statements of case in force immediately before 2 nd October 2006 apply as if they had not been revoked.(The rules relating to access by a non-party to statements of case in force immediately before 2 nd October 2006 were contained in the former rule 5.4(5) to 5.4(9).

The rules of practice and procedure apply to litigants in person in the same way as represented parties. The provisions of this guide also apply to litigants in person. The Court will have regard to the fact a party is unrepresented (see CPR3.1A) but it will not usually apply a lower standard of compliance with rules, PDs or orders of the court (see Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] UKSC 12:)\\n\\n2.2 Basic practical information about bringing a case to court can be found on the government website: King's Bench Division: bring a case to the court GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).\\n\\n2.3 Represented parties must treat litigants in person with consideration and respect at all times during the conduct of the litigation. Similarly, litigants in person must show consideration and respect to their opponents, whether legally represented or not, and to the court.\\n\\n2.4 A litigant in person must give an address for service in England or Wales. If they are a claimant, the address will be required in the claim form or other document by which the proceedings are started. If they are a defendant, it will be in the acknowledgment of service form which must be sent to the court. It is essential that any change of address is notified in writing to the Central Office and to all other parties to the case, otherwise important communications such as notices of hearing dates may not reach the relevant person (although they are likely to be treated as having done so).\\n\\n2.5 The public is entitled to obtain copies of some of the documents that parties file at court unless the court has ordered otherwise. Please see further sections within this guide on online public search, open justice, anonymity, confidential documents, non disclosure orders and Tomlin orders and see CPR5.4B and 5.4C and PD5A.\\n\\n2.6 It is the duty of all parties to litigation, whether represented or not, to bring relevant matters to the attention of the court and not to mislead the court. This means for example that they must not misrepresent the law and must therefore inform the court of any relevant legislation or previous court decisions which are applicable to their case and of which they are aware (whether favourable or not to their case); and must draw the court's attention to any relevant irregularity.\\n\\n2.7 In addition, there is a particular duty when an application is made to the court without the other party being present (for example in the case of urgency or when seeing a judge at an 'Application without Notice'). Here the litigant is under a duty to disclose any facts or other matters (including arguments of fact or of law) which might be relevant to the court's decision, even if adverse to their case, and specifically draw the court's attention to such matters.\\n\\n2.8 In many cases the parties will need legal assistance, whether by way of advice, drafting, representation at hearings or otherwise. It is not the function of court staff to give legal advice; however, subject to that, they will do their best to assist any litigant. Judges are not in a position to give advice about the conduct of a claim\\n\\n2.9 There is general information available to litigants in person on the judiciary website here: Advice for Litigants in Person - Courts and Tribunals Judiciary\\n\\n2.10 The following is a non-exhaustive list of sources of assistance to litigants in person.\\n\\n2.11 Litigants in person who are enquiring as to the possibility of obtaining legal assistance or representation through legal aid may contact Civil Legal Advice at 03453454345 ( 9.00 am to 8.00 pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays) or on the website at https://www.gov.uk/civil-legal-advice. In general, while the availability of legal aid has become very restricted under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicants will probably be directed to pursue their enquiries via firms of solicitors practising in areas of legal aid.\\n\\n2.12 An online service which provides practical information on rights and the law in England and Wales. https://www.advicenow.org.uk/\\n\\n2.13 There is an RCJ Advice Bureau off the Main Hall at the RCJ. The Bureau runs an appointment-based service. To request an appointment, applicants should complete the civil triage form available on their website (www. rcjadvice.org.uk) and email it to them at civiltriage@rcjadvice.org or call into the office to complete the form between 9.30am and 1pm and 2pm and 4.30pm weekdays. Their website has details on all their services and how to access them (www.rcjadvice.org.uk)\\n\\n2.14 Support Through Court (previously known as The Personal Support Unit (PSU)) is an independent charity which supports litigants in person, witnesses, victims, their family members and other supporters attending the Royal Courts of Justice and other courts across the country. Requests vary from the very simple to the complex. Some people just require directions or advice about procedures. Others need to unburden themselves, while others request the moral and emotional support of being accompanied in court. STC can be particularly helpful for clients with special needs.\\n\\n2.15 The volunteers are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice or representation. They can provide procedural information, help to organise and complete paperwork, look up relevant information and discuss settling issues without going to court. They can help before hearings by helping litigants put their thoughts in order, provide emotional support in court and make sure the litigant understands what was discussed in the hearing and the next steps.\\n\\n2.16 The office in the RCJ is open Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 4 pm (closed for lunch between 1 and 1.45 pm ). Walk-ins are accepted subject to availability. Face-to-face and remote appointments can be booked in advance: https://www.supportthroughcourt.org/locations/ london/rcj-appointment/.\\n\\n2.17 Support for general enquiries is available on 02045205959 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 12.30pm.\\n\\n2.18 Its address is: Thomas Moore Building (ground floor), Royal Courts of Justice, Strand WC2A 2LL. Tel: 02045205959.\\n\\n2.19 There are charities through which qualified Lawyers provide advice without charge (known as \\\"pro bono\\\") for some cases. See https://www.lawworks. org.uk/ and https://weareadvocate.org.uk/.\\n\\n2.20 Advocate is the national pro bono charity of the Bar. They find barristers for people in England and Wales who are not eligible for legal aid and cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. They help with: Specialist legal advice, drafting and representation and help at mediation. Advocate works exclusively with barristers and, as such, can only consider cases that are appropriate for barrister assistance. In essence this means that it would need to be representation in a court or Tribunal in England or Wales or advice or drafting suitable for a barrister to provide. In practice this means different things for different areas of law. Applicants should visit www.weareadvocate. org.uk for information about how to apply.\\n\\n2.21 Barristers who are qualified to work under the direct access scheme can be contacted directly by litigants. This is not a free legal advice scheme but enables litigants to instruct a barrister directly to assist them for example with a court hearing. Further details can be found through the Bar Council direct access portal: Homepage (directaccessportal.co.uk)\\n\\n2.22 Hearings are dealt with more fully in Section 9 below, to which reference should be made. See in particular 9.88-9.89 about contacting the court in advance of any hearings if assistance is required to access the court due to disability or other vulnerability of a party or witness.\\n\\n2.23 Ordinarily, the claimant or applicant is asked to put together an indexed and paginated file of the relevant documents for the court for the purposes of the hearing (called hearing bundles). Where a claimant or applicant is unrepresented, a represented defendant or respondent may be directed to provide the hearing bundles. Parties often file at court, and serve on the other parties, skeleton arguments (written summaries of their arguments and submissions) before a hearing.\\n\\n2.24 Litigants in person should identify in advance of any hearing those points which they consider to be their strongest points, and they should put those points first in their oral and any written submissions to the court.\\n\\n2.25 Before a hearing starts a litigant in person should be given by any other party, and should provide to other parties, photocopies of any legal authorities (past judicial decisions and/or statutes and/or textbooks) which are to be cited to the court in addition to any skeleton argument(s). These should be provided well before the hearing rather than at the door of the court.\\n\\n2.26 In drafting proposed or actual case management directions the parties and the court should make use of any relevant standard directions (which can be found online at http://www.justice.gov.uk//courts/procedure-rules/civil) and adapt them to the circumstances of the case.\\n\\n2.27 Any legal representative in the case should ask the litigant in person to give their name (and to give details of any special arrangements that they may wish to request e.g. in consequence of any disability) to the usher or in-court support staff if they have not already done so.\\n\\n2.28 Proper allowances in relation to hearings will be made in recognition of the difficulties facing litigants in person. The court will aim to enable the unrepresented party's case to be put forward in a way which ensures that the proceedings are conducted fairly.\\n\\n2.29 Where a litigant in person is the applicant, the court may ask one of the represented parties to speak first in court and explain the case briefly and impartially, and to summarise the issues.\\n\\n2.30 The Judge may ask a litigant in person the matters about which their witness may be able to give evidence or on which a witness called by another party ought to be cross-examined, and if necessary put to the witness such questions as the court considers proper.\\n\\n2.31 If a litigant in person wishes to give oral evidence he or she will generally be required to do so from the witness box in the same manner as any other witness of fact.\\n\\n2.32 At the end of the hearing, the judge will explain the Order they make. Representatives for other parties should also explain the court's order after the hearing if the litigant in person does not appear to understand it.\\n\\n2.33 A litigant in person may be assisted at any hearing by an unqualified person (often referred to as a McKenzie friend) subject to the discretion of the court. The Court will generally consider a request by the litigant in person to have a McKenzie friend in accordance with the Guidance in Practice Note (McKenzie friends: Civil and Family Courts) [2010] 1 WLR 1881.\\n\\n2.34 There is a presumption that a McKenzie friend should be permitted but the Guidance gives various examples of reasons as to why they might not. Different considerations may apply where the person seeking the right of audience is being paid or remunerated to do so and litigants in person applying to have a McKenzie friend should be prepared to disclose whether the McKenzie friend is being paid or remunerated and if so how the pay or remuneration is calculated.\\n\\n2.35 The following is a summary of the requirements for the assistance of a McKenzie Friend:\\n\\n2.36 The court may stop a McKenzie Friend from assisting if the court believes there is good reason to do so in any individual case. If the court considers that a person is abusing the right to be a McKenzie Friend (for example, by attending in numerous claims to the detriment of the litigant(s) and/or the court) and this abuse amounts to an interference with the proper processes of the administration of justice, the court may make an order restricting or preventing a person from acting as a McKenzie Friend.\\n\\n2.37 If a person has been declared a vexatious litigant or has a civil restraint order against them, they are unlikely to be given permission to act as a McKenzie Friend.

The rules of practice and procedure apply to litigants in person in the same way as represented parties. The provisions of this guide also apply to litigants in person. The Court will have regard to the fact a party is unrepresented (see CPR3.1A) but it will not usually apply a lower standard of compliance with rules, PDs or orders of the court (see Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] UKSC 12:)\\n[2]: 2.2 Basic practical information about bringing a case to court can be found on the government website: King's Bench Division: bring a case to the court GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).\\n[3]: 2.3 Represented parties must treat litigants in person with consideration and respect at all times during the conduct of the litigation. Similarly, litigants in person must show consideration and respect to their opponents, whether legally represented or not, and to the court.\\n[4]: 2.4 A litigant in person must give an address for service in England or Wales. If they are a claimant, the address will be required in the claim form or other document by which the proceedings are started. If they are a defendant, it will be in the acknowledgment of service form which must be sent to the court. It is essential that any change of address is notified in writing to the Central Office and to all other parties to the case, otherwise important communications such as notices of hearing dates may not reach the relevant person (although they are likely to be treated as having done so).\\n[5]: 2.5 The public is entitled to obtain copies of some of the documents that parties file at court unless the court has ordered otherwise. Please see further sections within this guide on online public search, open justice, anonymity, confidential documents, non disclosure orders and Tomlin orders and see CPR5.4B and 5.4C and PD5A.\\n[6]: 2.6 It is the duty of all parties to litigation, whether represented or not, to bring relevant matters to the attention of the court and not to mislead the court. This means for example that they must not misrepresent the law and must therefore inform the court of any relevant legislation or previous court decisions which are applicable to their case and of which they are aware (whether favourable or not to their case); and must draw the court's attention to any relevant irregularity.\\n[7]: 2.7 In addition, there is a particular duty when an application is made to the court without the other party being present (for example in the case of urgency or when seeing a judge at an 'Application without Notice'). Here the litigant is under a duty to disclose any facts or other matters (including arguments of fact or of law) which might be relevant to the court's decision, even if adverse to their case, and specifically draw the court's attention to such matters.\\n[8]: 2.8 In many cases the parties will need legal assistance, whether by way of advice, drafting, representation at hearings or otherwise. It is not the function of court staff to give legal advice; however, subject to that, they will do their best to assist any litigant. Judges are not in a position to give advice about the conduct of a claim\\n[9]: 2.9 There is general information available to litigants in person on the judiciary website here: Advice for Litigants in Person - Courts and Tribunals Judiciary\\n[10]: 2.10 The following is a non-exhaustive list of sources of assistance to litigants in person.\\n[11]: 2.11 Litigants in person who are enquiring as to the possibility of obtaining legal assistance or representation through legal aid may contact Civil Legal Advice at 03453454345 ( 9.00 am to 8.00 pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays) or on the website at https://www.gov.uk/civil-legal-advice. In general, while the availability of legal aid has become very restricted under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicants will probably be directed to pursue their enquiries via firms of solicitors practising in areas of legal aid.\\n[12]: 2.12 An online service which provides practical information on rights and the law in England and Wales. https://www.advicenow.org.uk/\\n[13]: 2.13 There is an RCJ Advice Bureau off the Main Hall at the RCJ. The Bureau runs an appointment-based service. To request an appointment, applicants should complete the civil triage form available on their website (www. rcjadvice.org.uk) and email it to them at civiltriage@rcjadvice.org or call into the office to complete the form between 9.30am and 1pm and 2pm and 4.30pm weekdays. Their website has details on all their services and how to access them (www.rcjadvice.org.uk)\\n[14]: 2.14 Support Through Court (previously known as The Personal Support Unit (PSU)) is an independent charity which supports litigants in person, witnesses, victims, their family members and other supporters attending the Royal Courts of Justice and other courts across the country. Requests vary from the very simple to the complex. Some people just require directions or advice about procedures. Others need to unburden themselves, while others request the moral and emotional support of being accompanied in court. STC can be particularly helpful for clients with special needs.\\n[15]: 2.15 The volunteers are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice or representation. They can provide procedural information, help to organise and complete paperwork, look up relevant information and discuss settling issues without going to court. They can help before hearings by helping litigants put their thoughts in order, provide emotional support in court and make sure the litigant understands what was discussed in the hearing and the next steps.\\n[16]: 2.16 The office in the RCJ is open Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 4 pm (closed for lunch between 1 and 1.45 pm ). Walk-ins are accepted subject to availability. Face-to-face and remote appointments can be booked in advance: https://www.supportthroughcourt.org/locations/ london/rcj-appointment/.\\n[17]: 2.17 Support for general enquiries is available on 02045205959 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 12.30pm.\\n[18]: 2.18 Its address is: Thomas Moore Building (ground floor), Royal Courts of Justice, Strand WC2A 2LL. Tel: 02045205959.\\n[19]: 2.19 There are charities through which qualified Lawyers provide advice without charge (known as \\\"pro bono\\\") for some cases. See https://www.lawworks. org.uk/ and https://weareadvocate.org.uk/.\\n[20]: 2.20 Advocate is the national pro bono charity of the Bar. They find barristers for people in England and Wales who are not eligible for legal aid and cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. They help with: Specialist legal advice, drafting and representation and help at mediation. Advocate works exclusively with barristers and, as such, can only consider cases that are appropriate for barrister assistance. In essence this means that it would need to be representation in a court or Tribunal in England or Wales or advice or drafting suitable for a barrister to provide. In practice this means different things for different areas of law. Applicants should visit www.weareadvocate. org.uk for information about how to apply.\\n[21]: 2.21 Barristers who are qualified to work under the direct access scheme can be contacted directly by litigants. This is not a free legal advice scheme but enables litigants to instruct a barrister directly to assist them for example with a court hearing. Further details can be found through the Bar Council direct access portal: Homepage (directaccessportal.co.uk)\\n[22]: 2.22 Hearings are dealt with more fully in Section 9 below, to which reference should be made. See in particular 9.88-9.89 about contacting the court in advance of any hearings if assistance is required to access the court due to disability or other vulnerability of a party or witness.\\n[23]: 2.23 Ordinarily, the claimant or applicant is asked to put together an indexed and paginated file of the relevant documents for the court for the purposes of the hearing (called hearing bundles). Where a claimant or applicant is unrepresented, a represented defendant or respondent may be directed to provide the hearing bundles. Parties often file at court, and serve on the other parties, skeleton arguments (written summaries of their arguments and submissions) before a hearing.\\n[24]: 2.24 Litigants in person should identify in advance of any hearing those points which they consider to be their strongest points, and they should put those points first in their oral and any written submissions to the court.\\n[25]: 2.25 Before a hearing starts a litigant in person should be given by any other party, and should provide to other parties, photocopies of any legal authorities (past judicial decisions and/or statutes and/or textbooks) which are to be cited to the court in addition to any skeleton argument(s). These should be provided well before the hearing rather than at the door of the court.\\n[26]: 2.26 In drafting proposed or actual case management directions the parties and the court should make use of any relevant standard directions (which can be found online at http://www.justice.gov.uk//courts/procedure-rules/civil) and adapt them to the circumstances of the case.\\n[27]: 2.27 Any legal representative in the case should ask the litigant in person to give their name (and to give details of any special arrangements that they may wish to request e.g. in consequence of any disability) to the usher or in-court support staff if they have not already done so.\\n[28]: 2.28 Proper allowances in relation to hearings will be made in recognition of the difficulties facing litigants in person. The court will aim to enable the unrepresented party's case to be put forward in a way which ensures that the proceedings are conducted fairly.\\n[29]: 2.29 Where a litigant in person is the applicant, the court may ask one of the represented parties to speak first in court and explain the case briefly and impartially, and to summarise the issues.\\n[30]: 2.30 The Judge may ask a litigant in person the matters about which their witness may be able to give evidence or on which a witness called by another party ought to be cross-examined, and if necessary put to the witness such questions as the court considers proper.\\n[31]: 2.31 If a litigant in person wishes to give oral evidence he or she will generally be required to do so from the witness box in the same manner as any other witness of fact.\\n[32]: 2.32 At the end of the hearing, the judge will explain the Order they make. Representatives for other parties should also explain the court's order after the hearing if the litigant in person does not appear to understand it.\\n[33]: 2.33 A litigant in person may be assisted at any hearing by an unqualified person (often referred to as a McKenzie friend) subject to the discretion of the court. The Court will generally consider a request by the litigant in person to have a McKenzie friend in accordance with the Guidance in Practice Note (McKenzie friends: Civil and Family Courts) [2010] 1 WLR 1881.\\n[34]: 2.34 There is a presumption that a McKenzie friend should be permitted but the Guidance gives various examples of reasons as to why they might not. Different considerations may apply where the person seeking the right of audience is being paid or remunerated to do so and litigants in person applying to have a McKenzie friend should be prepared to disclose whether the McKenzie friend is being paid or remunerated and if so how the pay or remuneration is calculated.\\n[35]: 2.35 The following is a summary of the requirements for the assistance of a McKenzie Friend:\\n[36]: 2.36 The court may stop a McKenzie Friend from assisting if the court believes there is good reason to do so in any individual case. If the court considers that a person is abusing the right to be a McKenzie Friend (for example, by attending in numerous claims to the detriment of the litigant(s) and/or the court) and this abuse amounts to an interference with the proper processes of the administration of justice, the court may make an order restricting or preventing a person from acting as a McKenzie Friend.\\n[37]: 2.37 If a person has been declared a vexatious litigant or has a civil restraint order against them, they are unlikely to be given permission to act as a McKenzie Friend. See section 16 below on civil restraint orders and vexatious litigants.\\n[38]: 35.1\", \"Expert evidence shall be restricted to that which is reasonably required to resolve the proceedings.\", \"Interpretation and definitions\", \"---\\n[39]: 35.2\", \"(1) A reference to an 'expert' in this Part is a reference to a person who has been instructed to give or prepare expert evidence for the purpose of proceedings.\", \"(2) 'Single joint expert' means an expert instructed to prepare a report for the court on behalf of two or more of the parties (including the claimant) to the proceedings.\", \"Experts - overriding duty to the court\", \"---\\n[40]: 35.3\", \"(1) It is the duty of experts to help the court on matters within their expertise.\", \"(2) This duty overrides any obligation to the person from whom experts have received instructions or by whom they are paid.\", \"Court's power to restrict expert evidence\", \"---\\n[41]: 35.4\", \"(1) No party may call an expert or put in evidence an expert's report without the court's permission.\", \"(2) When parties apply for permission they must provide an estimate of the costs of the proposed expert evidence and identify -\", \"(a) the field in which expert evidence is required and the issues which the expert evidence will address; and\", \"(b) where practicable, the name of the proposed expert.\", \"(3) If permission is granted it shall be in relation only to the expert named or the field identified under paragraph (2).

The rules of practice and procedure apply to litigants in person in the same way as represented parties. The provisions of this guide also apply to litigants in person. The Court will have regard to the fact a party is unrepresented (see CPR3.1A) but it will not usually apply a lower standard of compliance with rules, PDs or orders of the court (see Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] UKSC 12:)\\n\\n2.2 Basic practical information about bringing a case to court can be found on the government website: King's Bench Division: bring a case to the court GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).\\n\\n2.3 Represented parties must treat litigants in person with consideration and respect at all times during the conduct of the litigation. Similarly, litigants in person must show consideration and respect to their opponents, whether legally represented or not, and to the court.\\n\\n2.4 A litigant in person must give an address for service in England or Wales. If they are a claimant, the address will be required in the claim form or other document by which the proceedings are started. If they are a defendant, it will be in the acknowledgment of service form which must be sent to the court. It is essential that any change of address is notified in writing to the Central Office and to all other parties to the case, otherwise important communications such as notices of hearing dates may not reach the relevant person (although they are likely to be treated as having done so).\\n\\n2.5 The public is entitled to obtain copies of some of the documents that parties file at court unless the court has ordered otherwise. Please see further sections within this guide on online public search, open justice, anonymity, confidential documents, non disclosure orders and Tomlin orders and see CPR5.4B and 5.4C and PD5A.\\n\\n2.6 It is the duty of all parties to litigation, whether represented or not, to bring relevant matters to the attention of the court and not to mislead the court. This means for example that they must not misrepresent the law and must therefore inform the court of any relevant legislation or previous court decisions which are applicable to their case and of which they are aware (whether favourable or not to their case); and must draw the court's attention to any relevant irregularity.\\n\\n2.7 In addition, there is a particular duty when an application is made to the court without the other party being present (for example in the case of urgency or when seeing a judge at an 'Application without Notice'). Here the litigant is under a duty to disclose any facts or other matters (including arguments of fact or of law) which might be relevant to the court's decision, even if adverse to their case, and specifically draw the court's attention to such matters.\\n\\n2.8 In many cases the parties will need legal assistance, whether by way of advice, drafting, representation at hearings or otherwise. It is not the function of court staff to give legal advice; however, subject to that, they will do their best to assist any litigant. Judges are not in a position to give advice about the conduct of a claim\\n\\n2.9 There is general information available to litigants in person on the judiciary website here: Advice for Litigants in Person - Courts and Tribunals Judiciary\\n\\n2.10 The following is a non-exhaustive list of sources of assistance to litigants in person.\\n\\n2.11 Litigants in person who are enquiring as to the possibility of obtaining legal assistance or representation through legal aid may contact Civil Legal Advice at 03453454345 ( 9.00 am to 8.00 pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays) or on the website at https://www.gov.uk/civil-legal-advice. In general, while the availability of legal aid has become very restricted under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicants will probably be directed to pursue their enquiries via firms of solicitors practising in areas of legal aid.\\n\\n2.12 An online service which provides practical information on rights and the law in England and Wales. https://www.advicenow.org.uk/\\n\\n2.13 There is an RCJ Advice Bureau off the Main Hall at the RCJ. The Bureau runs an appointment-based service. To request an appointment, applicants should complete the civil triage form available on their website (www. rcjadvice.org.uk) and email it to them at civiltriage@rcjadvice.org or call into the office to complete the form between 9.30am and 1pm and 2pm and 4.30pm weekdays. Their website has details on all their services and how to access them (www.rcjadvice.org.uk)\\n\\n2.14 Support Through Court (previously known as The Personal Support Unit (PSU)) is an independent charity which supports litigants in person, witnesses, victims, their family members and other supporters attending the Royal Courts of Justice and other courts across the country. Requests vary from the very simple to the complex. Some people just require directions or advice about procedures. Others need to unburden themselves, while others request the moral and emotional support of being accompanied in court. STC can be particularly helpful for clients with special needs.\\n\\n2.15 The volunteers are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice or representation. They can provide procedural information, help to organise and complete paperwork, look up relevant information and discuss settling issues without going to court. They can help before hearings by helping litigants put their thoughts in order, provide emotional support in court and make sure the litigant understands what was discussed in the hearing and the next steps.\\n\\n2.16 The office in the RCJ is open Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 4 pm (closed for lunch between 1 and 1.45 pm ). Walk-ins are accepted subject to availability. Face-to-face and remote appointments can be booked in advance: https://www.supportthroughcourt.org/locations/ london/rcj-appointment/.\\n\\n2.17 Support for general enquiries is available on 02045205959 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 12.30pm.\\n\\n2.18 Its address is: Thomas Moore Building (ground floor), Royal Courts of Justice, Strand WC2A 2LL. Tel: 02045205959.\\n\\n2.19 There are charities through which qualified Lawyers provide advice without charge (known as \\\"pro bono\\\") for some cases. See https://www.lawworks. org.uk/ and https://weareadvocate.org.uk/.\\n\\n2.20 Advocate is the national pro bono charity of the Bar. They find barristers for people in England and Wales who are not eligible for legal aid and cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. They help with: Specialist legal advice, drafting and representation and help at mediation. Advocate works exclusively with barristers and, as such, can only consider cases that are appropriate for barrister assistance. In essence this means that it would need to be representation in a court or Tribunal in England or Wales or advice or drafting suitable for a barrister to provide. In practice this means different things for different areas of law. Applicants should visit www.weareadvocate. org.uk for information about how to apply.\\n\\n2.21 Barristers who are qualified to work under the direct access scheme can be contacted directly by litigants. This is not a free legal advice scheme but enables litigants to instruct a barrister directly to assist them for example with a court hearing. Further details can be found through the Bar Council direct access portal: Homepage (directaccessportal.co.uk)\\n\\n2.22 Hearings are dealt with more fully in Section 9 below, to which reference should be made. See in particular 9.88-9.89 about contacting the court in advance of any hearings if assistance is required to access the court due to disability or other vulnerability of a party or witness.\\n\\n2.23 Ordinarily, the claimant or applicant is asked to put together an indexed and paginated file of the relevant documents for the court for the purposes of the hearing (called hearing bundles). Where a claimant or applicant is unrepresented, a represented defendant or respondent may be directed to provide the hearing bundles. Parties often file at court, and serve on the other parties, skeleton arguments (written summaries of their arguments and submissions) before a hearing.\\n\\n2.24 Litigants in person should identify in advance of any hearing those points which they consider to be their strongest points, and they should put those points first in their oral and any written submissions to the court.\\n\\n2.25 Before a hearing starts a litigant in person should be given by any other party, and should provide to other parties, photocopies of any legal authorities (past judicial decisions and/or statutes and/or textbooks) which are to be cited to the court in addition to any skeleton argument(s). These should be provided well before the hearing rather than at the door of the court.\\n\\n2.26 In drafting proposed or actual case management directions the parties and the court should make use of any relevant standard directions (which can be found online at http://www.justice.gov.uk//courts/procedure-rules/civil) and adapt them to the circumstances of the case.\\n\\n2.27 Any legal representative in the case should ask the litigant in person to give their name (and to give details of any special arrangements that they may wish to request e.g. in consequence of any disability) to the usher or in-court support staff if they have not already done so.\\n\\n2.28 Proper allowances in relation to hearings will be made in recognition of the difficulties facing litigants in person. The court will aim to enable the unrepresented party's case to be put forward in a way which ensures that the proceedings are conducted fairly.\\n\\n2.29 Where a litigant in person is the applicant, the court may ask one of the represented parties to speak first in court and explain the case briefly and impartially, and to summarise the issues.\\n\\n2.30 The Judge may ask a litigant in person the matters about which their witness may be able to give evidence or on which a witness called by another party ought to be cross-examined, and if necessary put to the witness such questions as the court considers proper.\\n\\n2.31 If a litigant in person wishes to give oral evidence he or she will generally be required to do so from the witness box in the same manner as any other witness of fact.\\n\\n2.32 At the end of the hearing, the judge will explain the Order they make. Representatives for other parties should also explain the court's order after the hearing if the litigant in person does not appear to understand it.\\n\\n2.33 A litigant in person may be assisted at any hearing by an unqualified person (often referred to as a McKenzie friend) subject to the discretion of the court. The Court will generally consider a request by the litigant in person to have a McKenzie friend in accordance with the Guidance in Practice Note (McKenzie friends: Civil and Family Courts) [2010] 1 WLR 1881.\\n\\n2.34 There is a presumption that a McKenzie friend should be permitted but the Guidance gives various examples of reasons as to why they might not. Different considerations may apply where the person seeking the right of audience is being paid or remunerated to do so and litigants in person applying to have a McKenzie friend should be prepared to disclose whether the McKenzie friend is being paid or remunerated and if so how the pay or remuneration is calculated.\\n\\n2.35 The following is a summary of the requirements for the assistance of a McKenzie Friend:\\n\\n2.36 The court may stop a McKenzie Friend from assisting if the court believes there is good reason to do so in any individual case. If the court considers that a person is abusing the right to be a McKenzie Friend (for example, by attending in numerous claims to the detriment of the litigant(s) and/or the court) and this abuse amounts to an interference with the proper processes of the administration of justice, the court may make an order restricting or preventing a person from acting as a McKenzie Friend.\\n\\n2.37 If a person has been declared a vexatious litigant or has a civil restraint order against them, they are unlikely to be given permission to act as a McKenzie Friend.

The Court will have regard to the fact a party is unrepresented (see CPR3.1A) but it will not usually apply a lower standard of compliance with rules, PDs or orders of the court (see Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] UKSC 12:)\\n[17]: 2.2 Basic practical information about bringing a case to court can be found on the government website: King's Bench Division: bring a case to the court GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).\\n[18]: 2.3 Represented parties must treat litigants in person with consideration and respect at all times during the conduct of the litigation.

If they are a claimant, the address will be required in the claim form or other document by which the proceedings are started. If they are a defendant, it will be in the acknowledgment of service form which must be sent to the court. It is essential that any change of address is notified in writing to the Central Office and to all other parties to the case, otherwise important communications such as notices of hearing dates may not reach the relevant person (although they are likely to be treated as having done so).\\n[20]: 2.5 The public is entitled to obtain copies of some of the documents that parties file at court unless the court has ordered otherwise. Please see further sections within this guide on online public search, open justice, anonymity, confidential documents, non disclosure orders and Tomlin orders and see CPR5.4B and 5.4C and PD5A.\\n[21]: 2.6 It is the duty of all parties to litigation, whether represented or not, to bring relevant matters to the attention of the court and not to mislead the court. This means for example that they must not misrepresent the law and must therefore inform the court of any relevant legislation or previous court decisions which are applicable to their case and of which they are aware (whether favourable or not to their case); and must draw the court's attention to any relevant irregularity.\\n[22]: 2.7 In addition, there is a particular duty when an application is made to the court without the other party being present (for example in the case of urgency or when seeing a judge at an 'Application without Notice'). Here the litigant is under a duty to disclose any facts or other matters (including arguments of fact or of law) which might be relevant to the court's decision, even if adverse to their case, and specifically draw the court's attention to such matters.\\n[23]: 2.8 In many cases the parties will need legal assistance, whether by way of advice, drafting, representation at hearings or otherwise. It is not the function of court staff to give legal advice; however, subject to that, they will do their best to assist any litigant. Judges are not in a position to give advice about the conduct of a claim\\n[24]: 2.9 There is general information available to litigants in person on the judiciary website here: Advice for Litigants in Person - Courts and Tribunals Judiciary\\n[25]: 2.10 The following is a non-exhaustive list of sources of assistance to litigants in person.\\n[26]: 2.11 Litigants in person who are enquiring as to the possibility of obtaining legal assistance or representation through legal aid may contact Civil Legal Advice at 03453454345 ( 9.00 am to 8.00 pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays) or on the website at https://www.gov.uk/civil-legal-advice. In general, while the availability of legal aid has become very restricted under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, applicants will probably be directed to pursue their enquiries via firms of solicitors practising in areas of legal aid.\\n[27]: 2.12 An online service which provides practical information on rights and the law in England and Wales. https://www.advicenow.org.uk/\\n[28]: 2.13 There is an RCJ Advice Bureau off the Main Hall at the RCJ. The Bureau runs an appointment-based service. To request an appointment, applicants should complete the civil triage form available on their website (www. rcjadvice.org.uk) and email it to them at civiltriage@rcjadvice.org or call into the office to complete the form between 9.30am and 1pm and 2pm and 4.30pm weekdays. Their website has details on all their services and how to access them (www.rcjadvice.org.uk)\\n[29]: 2.14 Support Through Court (previously known as The Personal Support Unit (PSU)) is an independent charity which supports litigants in person, witnesses, victims, their family members and other supporters attending the Royal Courts of Justice and other courts across the country. Requests vary from the very simple to the complex. Some people just require directions or advice about procedures. Others need to unburden themselves, while others request the moral and emotional support of being accompanied in court. STC can be particularly helpful for clients with special needs.\\n[30]: 2.15 The volunteers are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice or representation. They can provide procedural information, help to organise and complete paperwork, look up relevant information and discuss settling issues without going to court. They can help before hearings by helping litigants put their thoughts in order, provide emotional support in court and make sure the litigant understands what was discussed in the hearing and the next steps.\\n[31]: 2.16 The office in the RCJ is open Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 4 pm (closed for lunch between 1 and 1.45 pm ). Walk-ins are accepted subject to availability. Face-to-face and remote appointments can be booked in advance: https://www.supportthroughcourt.org/locations/ london/rcj-appointment/.\\n[32]: 2.17 Support for general enquiries is available on 02045205959 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 12.30pm.\\n[33]: 2.18 Its address is: Thomas Moore Building (ground floor), Royal Courts of Justice, Strand WC2A 2LL. Tel: 02045205959.\\n[34]: 2.19 There are charities through which qualified Lawyers provide advice without charge (known as \\\"pro bono\\\") for some cases. See https://www.lawworks. org.uk/ and https://weareadvocate.org.uk/.\\n[35]: 2.20 Advocate is the national pro bono charity of the Bar. They find barristers for people in England and Wales who are not eligible for legal aid and cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. They help with: Specialist legal advice, drafting and representation and help at mediation. Advocate works exclusively with barristers and, as such, can only consider cases that are appropriate for barrister assistance. In essence this means that it would need to be representation in a court or Tribunal in England or Wales or advice or drafting suitable for a barrister to provide. In practice this means different things for different areas of law. Applicants should visit www.weareadvocate. org.uk for information about how to apply.\\n[36]: 2.21 Barristers who are qualified to work under the direct access scheme can be contacted directly by litigants. This is not a free legal advice scheme but enables litigants to instruct a barrister directly to assist them for example with a court hearing. Further details can be found through the Bar Council direct access portal: Homepage (directaccessportal.co.uk)\\n[37]: 2.22 Hearings are dealt with more fully in Section 9 below, to which reference should be made. See in particular 9.88-9.89 about contacting the court in advance of any hearings if assistance is required to access the court due to disability or other vulnerability of a party or witness.\\n[38]: 2.23 Ordinarily, the claimant or applicant is asked to put together an indexed and paginated file of the relevant documents for the court for the purposes of the hearing (called hearing bundles). Where a claimant or applicant is unrepresented, a represented defendant or respondent may be directed to provide the hearing bundles. Parties often file at court, and serve on the other parties, skeleton arguments (written summaries of their arguments and submissions) before a hearing.\\n[39]: 2.24 Litigants in person should identify in advance of any hearing those points which they consider to be their strongest points, and they should put those points first in their oral and any written submissions to the court.\\n[40]: 2.25 Before a hearing starts a litigant in person should be given by any other party, and should provide to other parties, photocopies of any legal authorities (past judicial decisions and/or statutes and/or textbooks) which are to be cited to the court in addition to any skeleton argument(s). These should be provided well before the hearing rather than at the door of the court.\\n[41]: 2.26 In drafting proposed or actual case management directions the parties and the court should make use of any relevant standard directions (which can be found online at http://www.justice.gov.uk//courts/procedure-rules/civil) and adapt them to the circumstances of the case.\\n[42]: 2.27 Any legal representative in the case should ask the litigant in person to give their name (and to give details of any special arrangements that they may wish to request e.g. in consequence of any disability) to the usher or in-court support staff if they have not already done so.\\n[43]: 2.28 Proper allowances in relation to hearings will be made in recognition of the difficulties facing litigants in person. The court will aim to enable the unrepresented party's case to be put forward in a way which ensures that the proceedings are conducted fairly.\\n[44]: 2.29 Where a litigant in person is the applicant, the court may ask one of the represented parties to speak first in court and explain the case briefly and impartially, and to summarise the issues.\\n[45]: 2.30 The Judge may ask a litigant in person the matters about which their witness may be able to give evidence or on which a witness called by another party ought to be cross-examined, and if necessary put to the witness such questions as the court considers proper.\\n[46]: 2.31 If a litigant in person wishes to give oral evidence he or she will generally be required to do so from the witness box in the same manner as any other witness of fact.\\n[47]: 2.32 At the end of the hearing, the judge will explain the Order they make. Representatives for other parties should also explain the court's order after the hearing if the litigant in person does not appear to understand it.\\n[48]: 2.33 A litigant in person may be assisted at any hearing by an unqualified person (often referred to as a McKenzie friend) subject to the discretion of the court. The Court will generally consider a request by the litigant in person to have a McKenzie friend in accordance with the Guidance in Practice Note (McKenzie friends: Civil and Family Courts) [2010] 1 WLR 1881.\\n[49]: 2.34 There is a presumption that a McKenzie friend should be permitted but the Guidance gives various examples of reasons as to why they might not. Different considerations may apply where the person seeking the right of audience is being paid or remunerated to do so and litigants in person applying to have a McKenzie friend should be prepared to disclose whether the McKenzie friend is being paid or remunerated and if so how the pay or remuneration is calculated.\\n[50]: 2.35 The following is a summary of the requirements for the assistance of a McKenzie Friend:\\n[51]: 2.36 The court may stop a McKenzie Friend from assisting if the court believes there is good reason to do so in any individual case. If the court considers that a person is abusing the right to be a McKenzie Friend (for example, by attending in numerous claims to the detriment of the litigant(s) and/or the court) and this abuse amounts to an interference with the proper processes of the administration of justice, the court may make an order restricting or preventing a person from acting as a McKenzie Friend.\\n[52]: 2.37 If a person has been declared a vexatious litigant or has a civil restraint order against them, they are unlikely to be given permission to act as a McKenzie Friend. See section 16 below on civil restraint orders and vexatious litigants.\\n[53]: 35.1\", \"Expert evidence shall be restricted to that which is reasonably required to resolve the proceedings.\", \"Interpretation and definitions\", \"---\\n[54]: 35.2\", \"(1) A reference to an 'expert' in this Part is a reference to a person who has been instructed to give or prepare expert evidence for the purpose of proceedings.\", \"(2) 'Single joint expert' means an expert instructed to prepare a report for the court on behalf of two or more of the parties (including the claimant) to the proceedings.\", \"Experts - overriding duty to the court\", \"---\\n[55]: 35.3\", \"(1) It is the duty of experts to help the court on matters within their expertise.\", \"(2) This duty overrides any obligation to the person from whom experts have received instructions or by whom they are paid.\", \"Court's power to restrict expert evidence\", \"---\\n[56]: 35.4\", \"(1) No party may call an expert or put in evidence an expert's report without the court's permission.\", \"(2) When parties apply for permission they must provide an estimate of the costs of the proposed expert evidence and identify -\", \"(a) the field in which expert evidence is required and the issues which the expert evidence will address; and\", \"(b) where practicable, the name of the proposed expert.\", \"(3) If permission is granted it shall be in relation only to the expert named or the field identified under paragraph (2).
