[Part 87 Applications for writ of habeas corpus]\n- How to commence (87.2(1)): The applicant must file a claim form under Part 8 and a witness statement or affidavit.

In your answer, cover: (1) who qualifies as a stakeholder (definition and scope); (2) the court in which the application must be made depending on whether a claim is pending; (3) the form of the stakeholder application and the circumstances under which a Part 8 claim form must be used versus an application notice under Part 23; (4) the required content of the stakeholder's witness statement accompanying the application; (5) the service obligations on other persons with claims; and (6) the timetable and content of the respondent's witness statement in response. Distinguish between cases where a claim is pending against the stakeholder and where there is no pending claim.", "truth": "Answer: A stakeholder is defined in Part 86 as a person to whom the requirements in rule 86.1(1) apply; namely, a person who is under a liability in respect of a debt or in respect of money, goods or chattels, and against whom competing claims are made or expected to be made by two or more persons in respect of that debt or money or for those goods or chattels. In other words, the stakeholder is the liable party faced with competing claimants. This scope is set out in 86.1, with the term 'stakeholder' defined in 86.1(2) as the person to whom paragraph (1) applies. A stakeholder may seek a court direction as to whom the stakeholder should pay the debt or money or to whom the goods or chattels should be given (86.2(1)). The application must be brought in the court specified by 86.2(2): if there is an existing claim pending against the stakeholder, the application must be to the court in which that claim is pending; if no claim is pending, the application must be to the court in which the stakeholder might be sued. The form of the stakeholder application is set out in 86.2(3): it must be made by a Part 8 claim form, unless it is being made in an existing claim, in which case it must be made by an application notice in accordance with Part 23. The stakeholder\u2019s application must be supported by a witness statement (86.2(4)) containing three assertions: (a) the stakeholder claims no interest in the subject-matter in dispute other than for charges or costs; (b) the stakeholder does not collude with any of the claimants to that subject-matter; and (c) the stakeholder is willing to pay or transfer the subject-matter into court or to dispose of it as the court may direct. The stakeholder must also serve the claim form or application notice on all other persons who, so far as they are aware, assert a claim to the subject-matter of the stakeholder application (86.2(5)). In response, a respondent who has been served must file at court and serve on the stakeholder a witness statement within 14 days, stating any money and describing any goods and chattels (the text in 86.2(6) being truncated in the provided extract but clearly requiring a respondent statement). The procedural sequence thus comprises: (i) identify a stakeholder under 86.1; (ii) determine the proper court under 86.2(2); (iii) issue the application using a Part 8 form (or application notice in an existing claim per 86.2(3)); (iv) accompany the application with a witness statement meeting the criteria in 86.2(4); (v) serve on all known claimants under 86.2(5); and (vi) obtain a respondent response within 14 days via a witness statement detailing money and goods/chattels under 86.2(6). This framework applies regardless of whether a claim is pending (existing claim) or not, with the key distinction being the appropriate court and the form of the filing as per 86.2(2) and 86.2(3).

The court must have regard to the circumstances set out in Rule 30.3(2) when deciding whether to order a transfer. [Practice Direction 66]\n\n- Crown-specific factor mandatory under 30.3(2)(h): Rule 30.3(2)(h) requires the court to have regard to the location of the relevant government department or officers of the Crown and, where appropriate, any relevant public interest, when considering a transfer. This is a central Crown-proceedings consideration and can influence venue choice alongside all other applicable factors. [Practice Direction 66]\n\n- Attorney General's Note: The Attorney General will publish notes concerning the organisation of the Government Legal Service and matters relevant to venue. When considering questions of venue under Rule 30.3(2), the court should have regard to the Attorney General's note in addition to all other circumstances. This Note operates as supplementary guidance to the Practice Direction. [1.2] [Practice Direction 66]\n\n- Annex 1 \u2013 Disputes as to Venue: Factors to be taken into Consideration: The Practice Direction includes Annex 1, which sets out factors to be considered in disputes as to venue. The court should consult Annex 1 for additional criteria and guidance on appropriate venue, alongside Rule 30.3(2) and the Crown-specific factors. While the exact factors are not enumerated in the text provided, Annex 1 is expressly part of the Crown Proceedings PD and informs decision-making. [Annex 1] [Practice Direction 66]\n\n- Service of documents on the Crown (Rule 2.1): In civil proceedings by or against the Crown, documents that must be served on the Crown must be served in accordance with CPR 6.10 or CPR 6.23(7). The PRACTICE DIRECTION notes that the list published under section 17 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 of the solicitors acting for the different government departments (and their addresses) is annexed to the Practice Direction. This establishes who must be served and where. [2.1] [Practice Direction 66]\n\n- Annex \u2013 List of Authorised Government Departments under s.17 Crown Proceedings Act 1947: The PD provides an annex with the list of the solicitors acting for the different government departments and their addresses for service. The court must ensure service on the Crown is effected in accordance with the relevant rule and the correct department\u2019s solicitors as identified in the annex. [Practice Direction 66]\n\n- Practical steps for applying these authorities:\n  1) Confirm Crown status and determine the appropriate transfer mechanism under Rule 30.3(2) (and the relevant sections of the County Courts Act 1984). \n  2) Identify the relevant government department or Crown officers involved in the proceedings to assess the 30.3(2)(h) location factor. \n  3) Assess the location of the department or officers and weigh any relevant public interest in determining the preferred venue. \n  4) Review the Attorney General's Note as supplementary guidance to inform the venue decision. \n  5) Consult Annex 1 for additional venue factors that may influence whether the case should stay in the High Court or be transferred. \n  6) Check the proper service approach under Rule 6.10 or 6.23(7) and ensure service on the Crown is effected through the correct department solicitor listed in the annex. \n  7) If the court decides that a transfer is appropriate, issue a transfer order under the applicable provision (40(2), 41(1) or 42(2) of the County Courts Act 1984). \n  8) Document the reasoning, including how the 30.3(2)(h) location factor, the AG\u2019s Note, Annex 1 factors, and service considerations influenced the decision. \n\n- Interaction and balance: The choice of venue will reflect a balance between the statutory transfer framework, Crown-specific considerations (notably the location of the department/officers and any public interest), guidance from the Attorney General, and practical service requirements. The location factor can be decisive where the Crown department\u2019s offices are located far from the current forum or where public interest considerations strongly favour a particular venue. However, the court must still weigh all relevant circumstances under Rule 30.3(2) and treat the AG\u2019s Note and Annex 1 as part of the overall evidentiary and legal context.

For an individual carrying on business other than in their own name, the heading must include the full name of the individual, the title by which they are known, and the full trading name (for example, Jane Smith 'trading as' or 'T/as').

This implies that the specific procedural route is governed by Part 7 (High Court procedure) rather than the standard Part 8/County Court path, notwithstanding the general rule that landlord and tenant claims should normally be brought in the county court (subject to jurisdiction) (2.2(1)). The County Court option remains available only under the ordinary jurisdictional framework, with the County Court hearing centre issuing the claim and sending it to the centre serving the land (2.2(2)). If a claimant starts such a claim in the High Court and the court later decides that it should have been started in the county court, the court will normally strike the claim out or transfer it to the county court on its own initiative, which is likely to result in delay (2.3). In summary, these two specific categories require using Part 7 as modified by Part 56, with potential forum repercussions if misfiled in the High Court rather than the county court, including possible strike-out/transfer and timetable disruption.

Key points: \n- Absence of a statement of value and costs implications: Rule 16.3 normally requires a statement of value in the claim form, but in the Commercial Court rule 58.5(2) confirms that rule 16.3 does not apply. However, if no statement of value is included, costs management under Section II of Part 3 and PD3E will apply to the claim unless the court orders otherwise, even if the value is \u00a310 million or more. Thus, lack of a value statement triggers automatic costs management unless the court orders otherwise. [B.  Commencement, Transfer and Removal, B.4  Part 7 claims (p. 19)] \n- Particulars of claim and timing: Particulars of claim may be served with the claim form but are not compulsory in the Commercial Court. If particulars are not contained in or served with the claim form, the claim form must include a statement that if an acknowledgment of service is filed indicating an intention to defend, particulars will follow (58.5(1)(a)). If particulars do not accompany the claim form, they must be served within 28 days of the defendant filing an acknowledgment of service indicating an intention to defend (58.5(1)(c)). In the scenario, since no particulars were served with the claim form, the claimant must ensure the claim form contains the 58.5(1)(a) statement and prepare to serve the particulars within 28 days after the defendant files an acknowledgment of service indicating an intention to defend (AOS). [B.  Commencement, Transfer and Removal, B.4  Part 7 claims (p. 19)] \n- Requirement to serve the three forms: The three forms specified in rule 7.8(1) must be served with the claim form; one of these is a form for acknowledging service (58.5(1)(b)). Therefore, failure to serve these forms with the claim form could render the claim defective. [B.  Commencement, Transfer and Removal, B.4  Part 7 claims (p. 19)] \n- Court power to proceed without a statement of case: Rule 58.11 allows the Court to order that the case proceed without the filing or service of particulars of claim or defence or any other statement of case; this is an exceptional measure to be used with caution and is unlikely to be appropriate unless all issues have been clearly defined in prior exchanges or applications and the issues are matters of law or construction. [B.  Commencement, Transfer and Removal, B.4  Part 7 claims (p. 19)] \n- Interest in the claim form: The claim form (and not only the particulars) must comply with the requirements of rules 16.4(1)(b) and 16.4(2) concerning interest; rule 58.5(3) governs how interest is stated in the claim form. Therefore, even if a value statement is not required, the claim form must properly address interest. [B.  Commencement, Transfer and Removal, B.4  Part 7 claims (p. 19)] \n- References to particulars and related rules: Rule 12.6(1)(a) includes references to particulars of claim in relation to claims for interest; see B.4.9 note (references to particulars of claim in rule 12.6(1)(a)).

Commencement, Transfer and Removal, B.4  Part 7 claims (p. 19)] \n- Practical steps for the claimant: \n  1) Acknowledge that the Commercial Court does not require a statement of value in the claim form, but ensure cost management implications are considered and a court order is sought if appropriate to exempt from costs management where necessary. \n  2) If no particulars are attached, include in the claim form the 58.5(1)(a) statement that particulars will follow if an AOS is filed, and prepare to serve the particulars within 28 days after the defendant files an acknowledgment of service indicating an intention to defend (58.5(1)(c)). \n  3) Ensure the three Rule 7.8(1) forms are served with the claim form (including the form for acknowledging service) (58.5(1)(b)). \n  4) Draft the claim to comply with 16.4(1)(b) and 16.4(2) on interest and ensure 58.5(3) is satisfied. \n  5) Be aware of the Court\u2019s discretion under 58.11 to order a case to proceed without a separate statement of case only in narrow circumstances where issues are clearly defined and primarily legal or construction, typically arising from prior exchanges.

Agreement or disagreement should be transparently documented, with rationale.\n\n3) Allocation to a designated Judge (Section D of the Circuit Commercial Guide)\n- What you must determine: Whether the case should be allocated to a designated Judge.\n- Information to provide: If a designated Judge is proposed, provide reasons for the view and ensure compliance with Section D of the Circuit Commercial Guide, including the grounds on which assignment to a particular Judge is contemplated (e.g., expertise needed, novel or complex issues, or otherwise to support coherent case management).\n- Rationale for decision: Designated Judges can help with consistent handling of complex, multi-issue, or high-value disputes; compliance with Section D ensures the process aligns with internal circuit guidance.\n\nHow these determinations feed into case-management decisions\n- The answers to items (1)(a)\u2013(d) determine the appropriate forum, the scope and pace of the proceedings, and whether consolidation or transfer is preferable. Item (2) shapes the conduct and format of the proceedings through the potential adoption of Shorter/Flexible Trials and IT-enabled efficiency. Item (3) influences leadership and consistency of rulings through designation of a Judge. Collectively, the CMIS findings guide the court in issuing a case management order, setting timetables, and allocating resources to achieve a just, expeditious, and cost-efficient resolution.\n\nNote: Throughout, the CMIS requires succinct, factual details and brief reasons for each conclusion, and when applicable, to indicate whether proposals are agreed or contested with rationales. The specific instruction to comply with Section D of the Circuit Commercial Guide is triggered if a designated Judge is proposed, and the reasons must be provided in compliance with that guidance.\n\nSource: Appendix A: Case Management Information Sheet -Circuit Commercial Courts, Preliminary: (p. 31).", "source_type": "Circuit Commercial Court", "category": "Circuit Commercial Court"}

The party charged with drawing up the order must lodge the draft with the court for approval; once approved, the order will be stamped by the Court and returned to that party for service upon all other parties. The order must refer to the date on which the order was made by stating 'Date order made: [date]', and orders should be referred to by this date rather than later dates reflecting submission, approval, and sealing processes.

{"question": "A judgment creditor obtains a judgment in the Technology and Construction Court and applies for a charging order over the judgment debtor's property under CPR 73.3 and 73.4 using Form N379, identifying the judgment and the property. The court, after an initial hearing, can make an interim charging order imposing a charge over the debtor's interest in the property and fixing a separate hearing to determine whether to make the charging order final. The interim charging order must be served in accordance with CPR 73.7. If the judgment debtor (or any other person) objects to the making of a final charging order, he must state his objection under CPR 73.10, and there will be a hearing at which the court decides whether to make the charging order final. If the judgment remains unsatisfied, the party with the final charging order may seek an order for sale of the property under CPR 73.10C. There is reference in PD 73 paragraph 4.2 that such a claim for sale ought to be started in the Chancery Division, but the rule itself contains no such restriction, and practical difficulties have arisen for parties who have obtained a judgment, an interim charging order and a final charging order in the TCC and who do not wish to transfer to another division. The Technology and Construction Court will, in appropriate circumstances and pursuant to the overriding objective, order sale where it is appropriate and cost-effective, particularly if the parties are agreed that is the most convenient course (as in Packman Lucas Limited v Mentmore Towers Ltd [2010] EWHC 1037 (TCC)).  In light of this framework, explain: (i) the three-stage charging order process (including Form N379 and the roles of the interim and final charging orders); (ii) the service requirement for the interim order and the procedure for objections leading to a final hearing; (iii) the conditions under which an interim order may become final and the procedure for moving to an order for sale; (iv) how the TCC may exercise jurisdiction to grant an order for sale notwithstanding the PD 73.4.2 guidance, including the relevant authority and considerations highlighted in Packman Lucas; and (v) the significance of the incomplete 17.5.5 heading and how its contemplated content would interact with the above process. Your explanation should be precise and grounded in the text, using appropriate UK legal terminology and ending with the required citation.", "truth": "The enforceable charging-order path proceeds in three stages under CPR 73, as described in the text. First, the judgment creditor applies to the Technology and Construction Court (TCC) for a charging order under CPR 73.3 and 73.4, using Form N379 which must identify the judgment and the property concerned. The application is initially dealt with by the judge without a hearing, and the judge may make an interim charging order imposing a charge over the judgment debtor\u2019s interest in the property and fix a hearing to consider whether to make the charging order final (stage 1). Second, the interim charging order must be served in accordance with CPR 73.7. If the judgment debtor or any other person objects to the making of a final charging order, the objection must be set out in accordance with CPR 73.10, and there will be a hearing at which the court will decide whether or not to make the charging order final (stage 2). Third, if the judgment remains unsatisfied, the holder of the final charging order may seek an order for the sale of the property under CPR 73.10C (stage 3). The text notes a potential procedural tension with PD 73 paragraph 4.2, which suggests that a claim for an order for sale to enforce a charging order should be started in the Chancery Division; however, the rule itself contains no such division restriction, and practical difficulties have arisen where judgments, interim charging orders, and final charging orders have been pursued in the TCC without transferring to another division (thus enabling a sale to be sought in the TCC where appropriate). Packman Lucas Limited v Mentmore Towers Ltd [2010] EWHC 1037 (TCC) is cited as supporting that the TCC may order sale in appropriate circumstances where it is the most convenient and cost-effective course, particularly where the parties agree. The 17.5.5 heading is truncated in the provided extract, but it signals the court\u2019s exercise of discretion in deciding whether provisions such as a final charging order or an order for sale should be granted, likely guided by the overriding objective. Accordingly, a practitioner should consider: (i) the three-stage charging-order process and the use of Form N379; (ii) service and objections under CPR 73.7 and 73.10 and the consequent hearing for finality; (iii) the transition from interim to final charging order and the procedure for obtaining an order for sale under CPR 73.10C; (iv) the permissible scope for the TCC to grant an order for sale notwithstanding PD 73.4.2, relying on the rule\u2019s lack of division restriction and the Packman Lucas approach; and (v) the likely considerations that would fill the gap in 17.5.5, namely, the court\u2019s discretion under the overriding objective when deciding whether a final charging order or sale is appropriate.

It can be extremely cost-effective and efficient, narrowing the issues between the parties and, in certain cases, resolving disputes altogether (8.1.1). PI hearings are particularly well suited to cases that can be resolved on specific points and may be decisive of the proceedings; even if not decisive, a PI can significantly reduce the scope and costs of the main trial (8.1.2). At the first Case Management Conference (CMC), the Court will expect submissions on whether there are matters that should be taken by way of Preliminary Issues in advance of the main trial (8.1.3). Generally, it is not appropriate to order the trial of preliminary issues until after the defence has been served, subject to paragraph 8.5 (8.1.3). After the first CMC, and at any time during the litigation, any party may raise with any other party the possibility of a PI hearing, and the Court will consider any application for a PI hearing; in many cases, although not invariably, a PI order will be made with the support of all parties (8.1.3). While hard and fast rules cannot be set, the criteria set out in paragraph 8.2 should assist the parties in deciding whether some or all disputes are suitable for a PI hearing (8.1.4). Drawbacks of PI in inappropriate cases include: (a) evidence may be duplicated; (b) the same witnesses may give evidence before different judges if there is a switch of assigned judge; and (c) findings may be made at the PI hearing (8.1.5).

For enforcement of arbitration awards, Section 10.7 provides that all applications for permission to enforce are governed by Section III of Part 62 (rules 62.17-62.19). An enforcement application may be made in an arbitration claim form without notice, provided it is supported by written evidence in accordance with CPR 62.18(6), and must be accompanied by two copies of the draft order, with the form of the order sought corresponding to the terms of the award. An order made without notice giving permission to enforce must give the defendant 14 days after service of the order (or longer if the order is to be served outside the jurisdiction) to apply to set it aside, and must state that it may not be enforced until after the expiry of the 14 days (or any longer period specified) or until any application to set aside has been finally disposed of: CPR 62.18(9) and (10).

The Guide is designed to ensure effective management of proceedings and requires the cooperation of the parties, their solicitors and counsel, who are expected to follow both the letter and the spirit of the Guide; if parties act unreasonably or fail to comply with these requirements, the court may impose sanctions including orders for costs. Parties and their advisors are expected to familiarise themselves with the CPR and, in particular, to understand the overriding objective at CPR 1.1; the Guide seeks to ensure that all cases are dealt with justly and at proportionate cost, including ensuring equality of footing, taking practicable steps to save expenditure, dealing with the dispute in ways proportionate to the size of the claim and cross-claim and its importance, and managing the case with regard to its complexity and the differing financial positions of the parties, with expedition and an appropriate share of the court\u2019s resources. The Court also expects the parties to observe the overriding objective and to conduct litigation efficiently, at proportionate cost and without rancour or aggressive correspondence, as illustrated in Gotch v Enelco [2015] EWHC 1802 (TCC).

When such an application is brought, it will be immediately assigned to a named judge. Given the probable urgency, the judge will usually require the parties to attend a directions hearing within 2 working days of the assignment and will then give the necessary directions to ensure the speedy resolution of the dispute. However, the guidance is not absolute: the examples in 9.4.1 are not exclusive, and not all applications with some connection to an adjudication will be heard with the abbreviated timescales applicable to adjudication enforcement. The label of 'an adjudication application' should not be used to obtain an expedited hearing (for example of a Part 8 claim for declaratory relief) where there is no other justification for an expedited hearing, and a judge may refuse to hear a claim or application that has been given this label in an attempt to jump the queue.

A case estimated at 6 days falls within the 5\u201310 day band.

There is a joint responsibility at an early stage for the parties to determine the nature of the case so that the PPD is adequately tailored to that case (11.3).\n\n- Accompanying signed statement: A PPD ought to be accompanied by a signed written statement which must (i) state that the person making the statement is personally acquainted with the facts to which the description relates; (ii) verify that the description is a true and complete description of the product or process; and (iii) acknowledge that the person may be required to attend court to be cross-examined on the contents of the description (11.4).\n\n- Inability to verify all aspects (and the use of a disclosure list): If a party is not able to verify that the PPD is a true and complete description of all relevant aspects of its product or process (for example because it does not know how certain components work), the correct course is to verify the parts it can and to serve a disclosure list in relation to the remainder (11.5). The disclosure list may or may not contain any documents.\n\n- PD57AC and the written statement: Practice Direction 57AC does not apply to the written state (11.5A). This means that the specific PD57AC formalities or requirements do not apply to the written statement accompanying the PPD (as stated in 11.5A).\n\n- Consequences of omissions or inaccuracies: A material omission or inaccuracy in the PPD could lead to a costly adjournment and may result in adverse orders, including as to costs (11.4).\n\n- Interplay with the disclosure framework: The obligations to provide disclosure under Part 31 are as modified by Rule 63.9, PD63.6.1-6.3, and as modified by Practice Direction 51U; the PPD framework is intended to operate within this modified regime and may be shaped by the Disclosure Pilot for the Business and Property Courts (11.1).\n\n- Practical effect: Parties may be called upon to prove the PPD at trial, so accuracy and completeness are critical; failures to adhere to these requirements can cause delays and adverse cost consequences (11.4).\n\n[11.

For a non-short application, parties should first attempt to agree dates for trials or interim applications in accordance with 12.3, referencing the Chancery Listing Office's advertised lead times and, if possible, approaching the Court by email with agreed hearing dates. If the parties cannot agree and an appointment to fix is required, the applicant should first obtain an appointment from the Chancery Listing Officer and provide 3 clear days\u2019 notice to all interested parties of the fixed date and time (12.3). Before listing, the applicant should consult with the proposed respondent about the subject-matter of the application; failure to properly consult prior to listing may lead to an adverse costs order (12.4).

If there is insufficient time to lodge hard copies before the deadline, documents of significance (notably skeleton arguments) should be supplied by email to the clerk of the judge concerned, followed up by clean hard copies (14.2). It is the joint responsibility of the parties to ensure that all relevant documents are lodged with the clerk by noon two days before the date fixed for hearing, unless the judge orders a different period or the guide prescribes otherwise (14.3).

{"question": "A landlord seeks possession of vacant commercial premises occupied by a group of trespassers who have begun to obstruct access and have announced plans to escalate into a large-scale, potentially violent protest. Police indicate a substantial risk of public disturbance and there is a real prospect of serious harm to persons and property if the occupation continues, requiring immediate attention. The landlord intends to issue the claim in the High Court (Kings Bench or Chancery Division) rather than the County Court. Assess whether issuing in the High Court is appropriate under CPR 55.3(2) and Annex 3, and explain: (i) what criteria justify High Court proceedings in trespasser possession claims, (ii) what the certificate filed with the claim must contain and its formal requirements (including the \u201cstatement of truth\u201d), (iii) how the guidance in PD55A applies to trespassers, and (iv) what alternative path would be typical if the threshold for High Court involvement is not met.", "truth": "Answer:\n- General rule and exceptional pathway: Annex 3 explains that, in most possession claims against trespassers, the claim should be issued in the County Court. A claim may be issued in the High Court only in exceptional cases, where the circumstances justify it under CPR 55.3(2) and related Practice Direction. The High Court option is available if the claimant files with the claim a certificate stating the reasons for bringing the claim in the High Court, and the certificate must be signed with a statement of truth (CR 55.3(2); the certificate mechanism is expressly referenced in Annex 3).\n- PD55A guidance and trespassers: PD55A para. 1.3(3) identifies one circumstance that may justify starting the claim in the High Court: when the claim is against trespassers and there is a substantial risk of public disturbance or of serious harm to persons or property which properly require immediate attention. The note also states that, unless there is real urgency, the High Court will rarely be the suitable venue. PD55A para. 1.6, however, has no relevance to claims against trespassers (i.e., its provisions do not apply to trespasser possession claims).\n- Application to the given scenario: The scenario presents a substantial risk of public disturbance and potential serious harm to persons and property, with a need for immediate attention. If the risk is indeed substantial and requires immediate action to prevent harm or disruption, this scenario could satisfy the exceptional High Court criterion under PD55A para. 1.3(3). The decision to proceed in the High Court would depend on demonstrating that the risk is truly substantial and urgent; otherwise, the default pathway remains the County Court.\n- Division concerns: Claims may be issued in either the King\u2019s Bench or the Chancery Division of the High Court; the annex does not require the land to be subject to a charge to issue in the Chancery Division (it explicitly notes this for claims under PD55A and clarifies that PD55A para. 1.6 is not relevant to trespassers). The practical choice between divisions would depend on the nature of the case and procedural considerations, but the trespasser context is governed by the high threshold for urgency.\n- Certificate requirements: Under CPR 55.3(2), the claimant may issue in the High Court only if a certificate is filed with the claim stating the reasons for bringing the claim in the High Court. The certificate must be signed with a statement of truth. The content should articulate the grounds under PD55A para. 1.3(3) (i.e., substantial risk of public disturbance or serious harm to persons or property requiring immediate attention) and explain why the High Court is warranted given the urgency and risk profile, including supporting evidence or anticipated evidence (e.g., police risk assessments, imminent threats, potential for widespread disruption).\n- Practical considerations and limitations: The High Court will rarely be suitable unless there is real urgency. Even where substantial risk exists, the claimant must satisfy the court that the risk requires immediate attention and that the High Court\u2019s involvement is justified as exceptional. If the risk is not truly urgent or substantial, the claimant should proceed in the County Court.\n- Summary guidance for the scenario: Given a substantial, immediate risk of public disturbance and serious harm to persons or property, the claim may be justified in the High Court if the certificate convincingly sets out the urgency and grounds under PD55A para. 1.3(3) and is supported by evidence. If these conditions cannot be satisfied, the County Court remains the appropriate forum. The land\u2019s lack of a charge and choice of division are secondary to the urgency criterion. The certificate must be filed with the claim and bear a statement of truth.\n- References: CPR 55.3(2); PD55A para. 1.3(3); PD55A para. 1.6 (not relevant to trespassers). [Annex 3.
