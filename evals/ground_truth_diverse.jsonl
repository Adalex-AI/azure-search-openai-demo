The TCC Pre-Action Protocol requires at least one face-to-face meeting between the parties before proceedings, with sufficient time to discuss and resolve the dispute; because this procedure has taken place, the court will not necessarily grant a stay of proceedings upon demand and must be satisfied that any adjournment is actually necessary to enable ADR to take place. At the first CMC, the court will want views on the likely efficacy of ADR, the appropriate timing of ADR, and the advantages and disadvantages of a short stay to allow ADR; after considering the representations, the court may order a short stay to facilitate ADR at that stage, or alternatively encourage the parties to seek ADR and allow it to occur within the court's timetable for resolution.

Your answer should be framed using UK legal terminology and reference the source document. End with the required citation. ", "truth": "Key framework and routes for challenging a 3.3(4) order:()\n- Nature of the order: A CPR 3.3(4) order is an order made by the court under its case-management power without a hearing. The order must contain a statement of the right to apply to have it set aside, varied or stayed. The right must be exercised within such period as may be specified; if no period is specified, the period is 7 days after service of the order on the affected party. Such an application should be made by the Part 23 procedure. The court may, under CPR 23.8, determine that a hearing would not be appropriate. Any challenge to such an order is by way of appeal. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n\nA. Primary challenge route: Part 23 application to set aside/var y/stay (CPR 3.3(4))\n- The affected party may apply to set aside, vary or stay the order via a Part 23 process within the 7-day window (or any specified period in the order). The application is typically made under Part 23, and the hearing may occur in person, unless CPR 23.8 allows a non-hearing determination. This is the procedural mechanism for reviewing the 3.3(4) order itself, rather than merely appealing it on its merits. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n- Time limit and form: The time limit is the period specified in the order; if none is specified, 7 days after service. The form of challenge is a Part 23 application. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n\nB. Second challenge route: CPR 3.3(5) application to set aside or vary; abuse of process concerns (Collier v Williams)\n- If a party applies to set aside or vary the order under CPR 3.3(5) (whether on paper or at a hearing), any further application under 3.3(5) should ordinarily be struck out as an abuse of process unless it is based on substantially different material from the earlier application. This principle is stated with reference to Collier v Williams [2006] EWCA Civ 20. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n- Practical implication: A later 3.3(5) application will generally be disallowed as an abuse of process unless the party shows substantially new material that could not have been raised in the earlier application, thereby allowing the court to entertain a fresh consideration on that basis. The Collier v Williams guidance governs when successive 3.3(5) applications are permissible. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n\nC. Distinction and interplay with appeal\n- Although a 3.3(4) order may be challenged via a Part 23 application under 3.3(4) or 3.3(5), the text expressly notes that \u201cany challenge to such an order is by way of appeal.\u201d This indicates that, ultimately, if the substantive objections to the order persist, an appeal lies as a separate remedy beyond any interim Part 23 challenge. The Part 23 route is for immediate relief or variation, whereas the appeal route provides a full appellate review of the order\u2019s merits. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n\nD. Interaction with Notice of Allocation and directions (10.3\u201310.4)\n- After a defence is filed, the court serves a notice of proposed allocation (the standard RCJ Annex 6 notice). This notice allocates the claim to the Multi-track and provides an opportunity for the parties to explain any objections. The parties are required to seek to agree proposed directions before the date for filing Direction Questionnaires (DQ). The notice requires the parties to file by the date specified. The purpose of the directions is to promote agreement and to enable the Master to identify the issues in dispute; assuming the parties comply with filing a DQ, the court will allocate the claim to the multi-track in appropriate cases. (10.3\u201310.4)\n- Interaction with the 3.3(4) order: The presence of a 3.3(4) order does not suspend or replace the allocation/directions process; rather, the challenge route to the order (Part 23 or appeal) operates alongside the normal case-management sequencing. If a party seeks to set aside or vary the 3.3(4) order via Part 23 or by appeal, those proceedings will run concurrently with, or be coordinated with, the ongoing allocation and DQ timetable. The court will continue with allocation and directions as per 10.3\u201310.4 unless the 3.3(4) order directly affects those steps and a separate order to stay or modify directions is sought and granted. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n\nE. Practical sequencing and risk areas\n- Timeliness: The 7-day window is strict unless a different period is specified in the order; failure to act within that window may foreclose the right to relief under the Part 23 process unless the court extends time or considers exceptional circumstances. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n- Abuse of process: Repeated 3.3(5) applications will be subject to abuse-of-process scrutiny unless substantially different material is introduced, as per Collier v Williams. This guards against forum shopping and unnecessary repetition of applications. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n- Choice of route: If the objective is immediate relief or alteration of the 3.3(4) order\u2019s effect, a Part 23 application is appropriate; for a comprehensive treatment of the order\u2019s merits, an appeal is the proper route. The text emphasizes that challenges are by appeal, reinforcing that Part 23 is for interim relief while an appeal provides final resolution. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n- Coordination with case management: Regardless of the challenge route, the allocation process (Annex 6) and the DQ timetable operate to identify issues and allocate to the multi-track where appropriate; the court will usually proceed with case-management directions unless a stay or variation of those steps is granted in the challenge. [10. Case Management (p. 92)]\n\nConclusion: In the scenario described, the appropriate first step to challenge the 3.3(4) order is to pursue a Part 23 application to set aside, vary, or stay within the period (7 days unless a different period is specified), noting that the court may determine the matter without a hearing under CPR 23.8. If additional or repeated relief is sought, a subsequent 3.3(5) application would generally be regarded as an abuse of process unless accompanied by substantially different material from the prior application (as per Collier v Williams). If the party wishes to challenge the order on its merits, an appeal remains available. All of this occurs alongside the normal allocation process (Annex 6) and the requirement to file a Direction Questionnaire by the prescribed date, with directions aimed at clarifying issues in dispute and facilitating multi-track allocation where appropriate.

{"question": "In a high-value personal injury claim in the King's Bench Division, parties are preparing a costs budget for the claim's lifecycle. The sums in issue are \u00a35,000,000. Non-monetary relief in issue is valued at \u00a30. The case is assessed as highly complex with novel questions on causation and liability. The defendant's conduct has generated additional work, estimated at a 30% uplift in time and cost relative to a typical case of this type due to extended disclosure obligations and procedural steps. The claimant is a vulnerable party (capacity limited) and a witness is also vulnerable. There is potential public interest and reputational factors surrounding the case. The parties propose a total costs budget of \u00a31,000,000 (Stage 1: \u00a3320,000; Stage 2: \u00a3680,000). Apply CPR 44.3(5) (proportionality) and CPR 44.4(2) (reasonableness) as described in Annex 8, to determine whether the proposed budget is proportionate and reasonable, identify which factors support or undermine proportionateness, and advise on whether and how the budget should be adjusted, including any recommended revised figures and the rationale for them.", "truth": "Answer:\n\n1. Governing framework (Annex 8). The note reiterates two linked tests that govern budgeting in high-value personal injury/clinical negligence claims: (i) proportionality under CPR 44.3(5), which requires costs incurred to bear a reasonable relationship to (a) sums in issue, (b) value of non-monetary relief, (c) complexity, (d) any additional work generated by the paying party\u2019s conduct, (e) wider factors such as reputation or public importance, and (f) any additional work due to vulnerability of a party or any witness; and (ii) reasonableness under CPR 44.4(2), which concerns the amount or value involved, the particular complexity or difficulty/novelty, the skill/effort/knowledge/responsibility involved, and the place and circumstances in which work is to be done. The court must have regard to both tests when assessing a costs budget. [Annex 8. Senior Master\u2019s note on Cost Budgeting]\n\n2. Application to the scenario \u2013 proportionate test under CPR 44.3(5).\n\n- Sums in issue (a): The claim value in issue is \u00a35,000,000. The proposed total budget is \u00a31,000,000. The relationship is 1,000,000 / 5,000,000 = 20%. A proportionality assessment asks whether the budget bears a reasonable relationship to the sums in issue. In a high-value, complex case, a 20% ratio may be defensible where other proportionality factors (notably complexity, additional work, and vulnerability) justify a higher budget; conversely, given the significant sums in issue, the court may expect a robust budget reflecting the scale of potential relief and the need for thorough preparation. The note requires consideration of the proportionality relationship to the sums in issue, among other factors. \n\n- Non-monetary relief in issue (b): \u00a30. While this reduces the monetary yardstick for proportionality, the test also captures other factors (complexity, additional work, vulnerability). The absence of non-monetary relief does not by itself render the budget non-proportional if other factors justify costs.\n\n- Complexity (c): The case is described as highly complex with novel causation issues. The note\u2019s proportionality test explicitly requires regard to complexity, which weighs strongly in favour of a more substantial budget. High complexity tends to increase the reasonable relationship between costs and sums in issue, potentially justifying a larger budget than the baseline 20% here.\n\n- Additional work generated by the paying party\u2019s conduct (d): A 30% uplift due to extended disclosure and procedural steps has been identified. This factor supports a higher budget and aligns with the requirement that costs be proportionate to work generated by the paying party\u2019s conduct.\n\n- Wider factors (e): Public importance or reputational concerns can justify a higher costs budget if relevant to the proceedings. If there is genuine public interest or reputational risk, this supports a larger budget.\n\n- Vulnerability (f): The claimant\u2019s vulnerability (capacity limitations) and vulnerability of a witness entail additional protective measures, care in case management, and potentially more time and resources. This factor supports a higher budget.\n\nOverall assessment under CPR 44.3(5): The proposed budget sits at \u00a31,000,000 for sums in issue of \u00a35,000,000 with 30% uplift for defendant conduct and vulnerability factors. Given the high complexity and vulnerability, there is a reasonable argument that the budget should be proportionate on the basis that the costs are commensurate with the additional work and safeguarding requirements, and with any public-interest considerations. However, the proportionate relationship to the \u00a35m sums is not automatically satisfied by a 20% budget where multiple qualitative factors are strongly in play. The court would scrutinise whether the uplift from complexity, vulnerability, and conduct justifies a higher proportion of the sums in issue than 20%.\n\n3. Application to the scenario \u2013 reasonableness test under CPR 44.4(2).\n\n- Amount/value of money involved (a): Sums in issue are \u00a35m; the proposed budget is \u00a31m. The budget should reflect the value of the money involved and the work required to protect it. The 1:5 ratio is not determinative, but the budget should be robust enough to cover detailed investigations, disclosure, and expert work.\n\n- Complexity (b): As noted, the case is highly complex with novel questions; this supports a larger budget, given the need for multiple experts, extensive document review, and sophisticated causation analysis.\n\n- Skill/effort/specialised knowledge (c): Personal injury/clinical negligence matters typically require high levels of specialism (quantum experts, liability experts, medical professionals). The budget must reflect the level of skill and responsibility required.\n\n- Place and circumstances (d): Not specified in the scenario; if it involves specialist courts, out-of-area experts, or complex logistics, these would further justify a larger budget. In the absence of such specifics, this factor neither pushes upwards nor downwards significantly.\n\nOverall assessment under CPR 44.4(2): The budget must reflect the substantial complexity and the increased effort due to the defendant\u2019s conduct, as well as the vulnerability considerations. A \u00a31,000,000 budget is plausible but may be understated given the high complexity, potential need for multiple rounds of disclosure, numerous experts, and safeguarding obligations. The reasonableness test would require demonstrating that the budget is appropriate to achieve or secure a just resolution, without overproviding. On balance, the proposed figure is arguable but warrants justification of uplift for the 30% extra work and for vulnerability, with sensitivity to the substantial sums in issue.\n\n4. Recommendations on adjustment and revised figures (practical approach for the court).\n\n- If the court accepts the need to reflect the 30% uplift due to defendant conduct and the vulnerability/complexity factors, a recalibration of the budget is prudent. The proportionality and reasonableness guidance would commonly support a budget that more accurately mirrors the volume of work and safeguarding costs anticipated.\n\n- Proposed revised budget (illustrative): Increase the total costs budget to reflect the 30% uplift plus an additional uplift for vulnerability and complexity. A reasonable adjustment might target around \u00a31.3m\u2013\u00a31.5m total (for example, Stage 1 \u00a3420,000 and Stage 2 \u00a3900,000, totaling \u00a31,320,000, or Stage 1 \u00a3450,000 and Stage 2 \u00a31,020,000 totaling \u00a31,470,000). This aligns with the need to cover extensive disclosure, expert reports, and welfare considerations for a vulnerable claimant and vulnerable witness, while still anchoring the budget to the sums in issue.\n\n- Alternatively, if the court remains cautious about uplift discretion, the parties could propose a staged budget with a clearly stated uplift rationale (30% for additional work due to defendant conduct, plus a vulnerability allowance of, for example, 5\u201315% depending on the level of safeguarding and expert requirements) rather than a fixed percentage. The court would then determine whether the stage-by-stage budgets are proportionate and reasonable in light of the factors in CPR 44.3(5) and 44.4(2).\n\n- Non-monetary relief remains \u00a30; ensure that any potential future non-monetary relief is scoped to avoid unnecessary budgeting for elements outside issue.\n\n- In all events, the court should require the parties to provide a precise breakdown of time/costs by stage, together with a narrative explanation linking each line item to the factors set out in CPR 44.3(5) and 44.4(2), in order to facilitate transparent proportionality assessment.\n\n5. Conclusion.\n\nThe proposed \u00a31,000,000 budget engages multiple proportionality and reasonableness factors: it is influenced by high complexity, the 30% uplift for defendant conduct, and the vulnerabilities involved. While the budget may be proportionate given the qualitative factors, the court would be justified in requesting a justification of the uplift and potentially adjusting the total upwards to reflect the significant work anticipated from complexity, vulnerability, and safeguarding requirements. The final determination should be grounded in a stage-by-stage breakdown that ties each item to the factors in CPR 44.3(5) and 44.4(2), with clear justification for any uplift beyond the baseline proportionate relation to sums in issue.\n\n[Annex 8.
